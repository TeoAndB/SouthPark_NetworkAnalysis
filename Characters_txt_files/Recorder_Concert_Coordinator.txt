She then instructs the concert crew to reprint and distribute the updated scores to all participants. This eventually led to a defecation incident worldwide when the participants play the brown note.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Recorder Concert Coordinator has long, curled brown hair, and wears an orange jacket over a white shirt, brown skirt, and black shoes. She is seen carrying a clipboard and a headphone set.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:竖笛演奏会协调员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Eliza J.
