The boys decide to strike back by making up the word 'mung', which is actually a word. The New York Kids mercilessly point out their mistake and rip on them again. This pushes the boys further into finding [[The Brown Note|the brown note]] and replacing the final note with it.\n\nThe result is that everyone in the world craps their pants. Twenty hours later the New York Kids finally discover that the boys are culprits, and they think it's cool so they apologize to the boys for ripping on them.\n\nAfter that episode, they were only seen on posters at [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]].\n\n==Appearance==\nLike any other group, they vary in sexes and races.
