They appeared in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[Ginger Cow]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe band performed in Jerusalem at the unification rally of the three Abrahamic faiths; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Before a packed stadium of all three adherents, the symbols of each faith melded together on a projected screen to form the Van Halen \"VH\" band logo. The rock group then launched into their most successful song \"[[Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love]]\" from their debut album ''Van Halen'' (1978). A CNN reporter on a rooftop proclaimed a ten-year peace party between the faiths as the concert proceeded behind him. Later, the band performed \"[[Hot for Teacher]]\" from their sixth album ''MCMLXXXIV'' or popularly known as ''1984''.\n\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n[[es:Van Halen]]\n[[zh:范·海伦]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]"
