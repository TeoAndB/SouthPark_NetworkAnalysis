His only physical appearance was in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\". He was not seen in his wife's funeral in [[Cartmanland]] for unknown reasons.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is arguing with [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and notes that he is half-bisexual. When [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] asserts that he is not, Cartman responds, ''\"Well, my grandpa was bi, so that makes me a quarter bi!\"'' However, these statements may be fabricated. Harold Cartman is later mentioned in \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\", when [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] asked Cartman if he wanted to talk to him on the phone.\n\n==Appearance==\nLike most of the Cartman family, he is morbidly obese. Harold's face is extremely wrinkled, most likely due to his age. He has balding, gray hair, and wears a red shirt and brown pants.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Harold Cartman\">\nHarold_Cartman.png|Harold in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe shares many of the Cartman family's mannerisms, as well as their laziness.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" - Debut Appearance.\n*\"[[Cat Orgy]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a portrait.\n*\"[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a photograph at the [[Cartman Residence]].\n*\"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a photograph with Mabel in the Cartman Residence.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a portrait with his wife.\n*\"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\" - (Mentioned) Liane asks her son if he wants to talk to Grampa over the phone.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Cartman Family}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n[[es:Harold Cartman]]\n[[ru:Гарольд Картман]]\n[[zh:哈罗德·卡特曼]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Cartman/Tenorman family]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]"
