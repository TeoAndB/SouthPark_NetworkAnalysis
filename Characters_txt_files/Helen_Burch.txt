She appears in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\".\n\n==Background==\nLike her son, she can only say her own name, she has a large head, and she uses a wheelchair. She presumably suffers from the same syndrome that Timmy does. In \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", when Timmy becomes a rock sensation with [[The Lords of the Underworld]], musician [[Phil Collins]] goes to extreme lengths to destroy his career under the false claims that he was trying to \"protect\" Timmy from being made fun of. He attempts to sway Helen into stopping him from performing, but due to her own disability, he finds her unresponsive to his attempts, as she is unable to say anything beyond her own name and flails around randomly. The family portrait shows the three of them sitting on their wheelchairs in front of the Eiffel Tower. Their house is green with a gas tank next to it.\n\n==Appearance==\nHelen has an abnormally large head. She is confined to wheelchairs due to her disability. Helen has long, orange hair. She wears an aqua-green coat, a slightly lighter aqua-green shirt, and a light purple, ankle-length skirt.\n\n==Personality==\nLittle is known of her personality, as she is unable to say anything other than her name due to her disability.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Timmy 2000]]\" - First appearance\n*\"[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:海伦·伯奇]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Eliza J.
