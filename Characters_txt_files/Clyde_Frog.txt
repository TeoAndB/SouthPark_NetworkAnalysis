It was known as Eric's most favorite toy, as evidenced in \"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\", where he says a tearful farewell to Clyde Frog before he goes on a dangerous mission. \n\nIn some episodes, when Eric was alone, he would ask Clyde Frog for advice, and he seems to have seen the stuffed animal as a friend as seen in \"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\". \n\n==Background==\n[[File:1201 killing clyde frog.jpg|Clyde Frog on South Park Studios.|thumb|left]]\nClyde Frog first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\". He was one of the stuffed animals at a tea party in Cartman's backyard. When Clyde Frog was asked by Eric what he thought about him, his reply was \"I think you're a big fat piece of crap\". In the episode \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\" he is seen in Mayor Cartman's office, and in the episode \"[[The Jeffersons]]\", in the toy grab machine at [[Michael Jackson|Mr. Jefferson's]] house you can see Clyde frog inside it in many scenes. Clyde Frog was torn apart in \"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\", when an enraged [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] ripped Clyde's head off as payback when finding out that Cartman had infected him with [[AIDS|HIV]], but Clyde Frog makes an appearance in-tact in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\". In [[South Park: The Complete Fourteenth Season|Season Fourteen DVD]], Clyde Frog was in a deleted scene for \"[[201]]\". He is also seen in the basement in \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\".\n\nHe ends up dying in the episode \"[[1%]]\". \n\nIn ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', Clyde Frog is the trophy given to the player if they get a silver medal.\n\n===Death===\nClyde Frog \"died\" in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode \"[[1%]]\". He was murdered at the hands of Cartman, who pretended it was [[Polly Prissypants]], after he was told to grow up and \"killed\" all of his stuffed dolls in a very dramatic way. He was the first out of Cartman's toys to \"die\".\n{{clear}}\n\n==Appearance==\nClyde Frog is an anthropomorphic, stuffed frog. He has a green body, a pink mouth, and a red tongue. In \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", and in \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\", Clyde Frog's body was colored differently, it was more gray than green.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Clyde Frog\">\nClydeF..png|Clyde Frog's slightly different body color.\nClyde Frog.jpg|Clyde Frog in \"[[Cat Orgy]]\".\n0307 ClydeFrog.jpg|Cartman plays with Clyde Frog in \"[[Cat Orgy]]\".\nWackyMolestationAdventure03.gif|Clyde Frog in Mayor Cartman's office in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\".\n1201ClydeFrogdamaged.JPG|Kyle rips off Clyde Frog's head in \"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" after Cartman infects him with HIV.\n1313 15.jpg|Clyde Frog in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\".\nOnePercentPromo2.jpg|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] cries to his stuffed toys including Clyde Frog in \"[[1%]]\".\n1512_ClydeFrog.jpg\n1512 1percent07.jpg|Clyde Frog's death in \"[[1%]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" - Seen at Cartman's tea party.\n*\"[[Cat Orgy]]\" - As Artemus Clyde Frog in Cartman's reenactment of the movie ''Wild Wild West''.\n*\"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\"\n*\"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\" - Seen in Mayor Cartman's office.\n*\"[[The Jeffersons]]\" - Clyde Frog toys are seen in the toy grab machine at Mr. Jefferson's house.\n*\"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\" - Cartman tearfully bids farewell to Clyde Frog before exterminating the hippies.\n*\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" - His head is ripped off by Kyle.\n*\"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" - Appears in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Appears in a deleted scene.\n*\"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\" - Seen in the basement.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - He is murdered along with the rest of Cartman's toys.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Clyde Frog is based on a character of the same name from a children's educational program from the late 1970s called ''[[Wikipedia:Clyde_Frog_Show|The Clyde Frog Show]]''.\n*Clyde Frog's design vaguely resmbles [[w:c:muppet:Kermit the Frog|Kermit the Frog]] from ''The Muppets''.\n*Cartman referred to him as \"Artemus Clyde Frog\" while playing ''Wild Wild West'' in the season 3 episode [[Cat Orgy]]. As this was the first time Clyde Frog had been directly referenced, many viewers came to believe this was the toy's name. However, Cartman was merely referencing the character \"Artemus Gordon\" from the movie - he also referred to [[Polly Prissypants]] as \"Salma Hayek\" (who acted in the film) and to himself as \"James West, cowboy and rap star\" (Will Smith's character).\n[[es:Rana Clyde]]\n[[fr:Clyde Frog]]\n[[ja:クライドフロッグ]]\n[[zh:克莱德蛙]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]"
