His birthday is April 10, as seen on his [[Facebook]] profile page in \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\". In \"[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]\", it is revealed that [[Betsy Donovan|Clyde's mother]] is Dutch, and as such, he has at least some Dutch ancestry. Clyde is a member of [[Craig's Gang]].\n\n==Background==\nClyde Donovan is a regular member of [[Craig's Gang]], along with [[Craig Tucker]], [[Jimmy Valmer]], and [[Token Black]].\n\nClyde made his first appearance in \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" as a background character in the third grade class, seated in front of [[Pip Pirrip]].\n\nClyde Donovan has his first speaking role in \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" as an Indian in the South Park play being performed for [[Kathie Lee Gifford]]. During \"[[Clubhouses]]\", he begins dating [[Bebe Stevens]] and they briefly get back together in \"[[The List]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]\", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] comments that Clyde would have helped in getting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] kidney for [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], but his appetite for tacos got in the way - referencing his weight, which had also been pointed out by Butters in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Lice Capades]]\", he thought at first that he was the only one in the school who had head lice. He did not want to reveal it or have it found out, because he feared he would be made fun of and embarrassed by Cartman and the rest of the class. However, Clyde's lice problem was not revealed to the others, as Kenny McCormick was accused by Cartman. This episode was the first time his last name was 'Harris', as stated at the lice inspection. However, in the later reruns, this was corrected.\n[[File:MetrosexualClyde.jpg|thumb|Clyde as a metrosexual.]]\nIn \"[[The List]]\", Clyde is listed through a doctored list as the cutest person by the girls, becoming arrogant and narcissistic. It is revealed that he was only listed as such, so that the girls could acquire free shoes from his father's shoe shop.\n\nIn \"[[Fatbeard]]\", Clyde decides to join Cartman's [[Pirate Club]] to live the life of a pirate. However, he is met with disappointment upon arrival in Somalia, observing the poor living conditions. Clyde eventually broke down into tears on two occasions.\n\nIn \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", Clyde's habit of leaving the toilet up eventually led to the death of [[Betsy Donovan|his mother]]. The boys, believing that Clyde is not to blame for the incident, decides to assist Clyde and sue the [[Sir John Harington|inventor of the toilet]] through a \"sue-ance\". However, during the trial the inventor reveals that the correct way to use the toilet is to sit inwards. Following this, Clyde begins to adopt the position, intentionally putting the toilet seat up after use and flipping off his mother.\n\n===Superhero Alter Ego===\n{{Main|Mosquito}}\n\n===Sports===\nClyde Donovan has been seen as a good athlete and is interested in sports. He plays football for the South Park cows in \"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" and \"[[The Coon]]\" and continues to show support for the team throughout \"[[Douche and Turd]]\". He, however, becomes very upset with the name change and during the change back he is shown to wear the jersey under his clothes. He is also on the basketball team in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" and was on the soccer team in \"[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]\". \n\nHe was seen playing baseball in \"[[The Losing Edge]]\" where he plays shortstop, which is usually the position of the best defensive player on a baseball team. Like all of the boys at [[South Park Elementary]], however, he hated the game and tried hard to lose it so they did not have to continue playing. Clyde is also a big fan of the [[Denver Broncos]], as seen in \"[[Marjorine]]\". In \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\", a lamp with the Colorado Avalanches can be seen in his room, implying that he might be a hockey fan. Additionally, in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', hockey gloves are part of his costume.\n\n==Criminal Record==\n*'''Indecent Exposure:''' In \"[[Wieners Out]]\", he joins Butters' movement and frequently pulls his pants down to reveal his genitals.\n*'''Filing a false police report:''' In \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\", he files a false police report that adults have been abusing kids.\n*'''Property Damage:''' In \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", he assists the other boys in destroying Cartman's electronics.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Sideway Clyde.png|thumb|left|Playing basketball with Stan.]]\nHe has medium-brown hair, wears a burgundy coat, grayish-brown trousers, and sometimes wears ocean-blue mittens. Underneath, he has been shown to wear a green T-shirt with a cow's face on the front. On occasion, he is seen wearing a sports jacket that looks similar to his usual coat. He has been labeled \"the second fattest kid next to Cartman\" despite appearing about the same weight as the others. He has a somewhat nasal voice, similar to that of Craig's, but lighter.\n\nIn \"[[Ginger Kids]]\", Clyde is shown in his pajamas, which consist of green pants and a collared, green shirt with a dinosaur on the left breast pocket.\n\nIn \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\", it is rumored that Clyde only has one testicle, though this is never actually confirmed.\n\nIn \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\", Clyde is announced as having a colostomy by [[Mr. Mackey]], and as such was incapable of and therefore innocent of defecating into a urinal. However, this was retconned in \"[[Lice Capades]]\" and \"[[Wieners Out]]\".\n\nIn the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Clyde wears a beige Hawaiian t-shirt, dark gray shorts, and blue sneakers. He also carries a golden watch on his left wrist.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Clyde Donovan}}\n\n==Personality==\nClyde is not very clever, or at least not good at mathematics and is often portrayed as one of the less intelligent members of the class. When his [[Herbert Garrison|teacher]] asks him what two times five equals, he guesses twelve - Garrison then referred to him as \"a complete retard\". Or when he writes a poor essay in another essay on why people need to recycle. However, considering that Mr. Garrison never actually ''teaches'' the kids, it's probably not Clyde's fault.\n\nHe has a habit of sobbing uncontrollably whenever he witnesses something upsetting. Examples of this are when he hears Cartman singing in \"[[Fourth Grade]]\", when the adults decide to give all of the money they would have spent on Christmas presents for their kids to the [[:Category:Broflovski / Schwartz family|Broflovskis]] in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", and when he realizes that there were no crystal clear lagoons, treasure, and plunder after he joined Cartman's \"Somalian pirate club\" in \"[[Fatbeard]]\". This usually gets an angry response from Cartman.\n\nOn several occasions when things get surreal in the show, Clyde shows little or no interest. For instance, when the boys' audition for a new fourth friend, and he is eliminated as a candidate, he eventually decides that it is stupid and shows no actual interest in being their fourth friend. Also, while everyone else is obsessing over the [[World of Warcraft]] game, he questions its importance and reads ''Playboy'' instead, which causes the \"[[Jenkins|rogue]]\" to defeat the other players once again. During \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" he does his homework instead of listening to the murder of [[Gordon Stoltski]] on the intercom.\n\nClyde seems to know a lot about movies. He has Lord of the Rings on DVD in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\". Other examples are in \"[[The Losing Edge]]\" and \"[[The List]]\".\n\nClyde appears to be one of the nicer boys, or at least he has a better sense of morality at times. In \"[[The Cissy]]\" Clyde is the only student in the whole school that stands up for Stan against Eric Cartman's bullying by telling him to \"lay off\". In \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\", he appeared to be shocked at himself when he said \"I'm not fat, goddammit!\" while filling in for Cartman as the fat kid. In \"[[Lice Capades]]\", he refused to sock bathe [[Kenny McCormick]] when Kenny is accused of having head lice since Clyde believed himself to be the only one who had lice. He also notified Ms. Garrison to stop the sock bathing and tried to delay the other boys until it arrived, when it is revealed that all the kids had head lice, this means Clyde is the only boy who felt guilty for dumping the target for having head lice onto Kenny, whereas all the other boys never contacted Mr. Garrison or showed even a bit of remorse. Clyde can as well be seen defending Cartman in \"[[Marjorine]]\". In \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\", Clyde even tried to take the fall for the person who took a crap in the urinal. In \"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]\", Clyde mentions that he takes the time to read the terms and conditions on the Apple store so that he knows what he is agreeing to.\n[[File:TheList039.png|thumb|left|Clyde admiring himself in \"[[The List]]\".]]\nIn \"[[The List]]\", when Clyde is listed on the corrupted list as best looking, he becomes arrogant and narcissistic. But he is still somewhat caring towards the others as he attempts to make [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] feel better for being listed last, though does it in a careless way.\n\nClyde seems to have a liking for adult-related materials. In the episode \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\", he is seen reading a ''Playboy'' magazine instead of playing the game, and in \"[[Ginger Kids]]\", the topic of his presentation is mentioned as \"lesbian cheerleaders.\" In the episode \"[[Marjorine]]\", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] says that one of her hobbies is, \"''getting my snootch pounded on Friday nights,''\" to which Clyde responds \"Nice.\", although he could also have been happy with how well the idea had turned out - judging by his tone, this was not the case.\n\nIn \"[[Lice Capades]]\", Clyde was extremely ashamed of having head lice, even going so far as to tell a little girl at the doctor's clinic that he had [[AIDS]] to avoid being found out.\n\nIn \"[[Marjorine]]\", Clyde stood up for Cartman when Kyle and Stan were ridiculing him for his discovery of the girls' future telling device. This surprised many of the boys who were in Cartman's basement at the time, including Cartman himself. Although this initially indicates that he is somewhat on Cartman's side, he ignores him along with the rest of the class in \"[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\". He may have only been curious about the future telling device Cartman was reporting and wanted Stan and Kyle to be quiet while Cartman explained. He might also still feel loyalty towards Cartman for returning to South Park in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\", evidenced by his willingness to accept Cartman as a leader, such as when he joined his crew in \"[[Fatbeard]]\". He also seems to be much more willing than the other kids to accept Cartman's bigoted views, possibly because he agrees with Cartman on occasion, saying [[Ginger Separatist Movement|ginger kids]] creeped him out in \"[[Ginger Kids]]\".\n\n==Family==\n===Parents===\n[[File:CrackBabyAthleticAssociation070.png|thumb|left|Roger and Betsy Donovan.]] He told the environmentalists in \"[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]\" that his father, like [[Randy Marsh]], is a geologist, though [[Roger Donovan|Mr. Donovan]] is only shown with Clyde alongside his mother. The couple appears again in the Atheists Club in \"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\", leading us to believe that Clyde's family, like most of South Park's residents, is Roman Catholic. He has a dog named [[Rex|Rex Donovan]], who had a sexual encounter with Stan's dog, [[Sparky|Sparky Marsh]]. His mother is referred to as [[Betsy Donovan|Martha]] in \"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\". His name suggests Irish or Scottish ancestry, however, his mother is Dutch, as revealed in \"[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]\".\n\nIn the [[Season Eleven|season eleven]] finale, \"[[The List]]\", it is revealed that his father owns a shoe shop. The girls declared him the cutest boy in South Park Elementary so that they could have easier shoe-shopping sprees. However, as mentioned above, Mr. Donovan was supposedly a geologist. Of course, he may have more than one job, or he may have quit geology since \"[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]\", and taken up a career as a shoe store owner. Another version of this goof is that he is not Clyde's real father at all.\n\nThe Donovan family apparently sold their house and moved to another as of the season eight episode \"[[The Jeffersons]]\", as it is mentioned that [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jefferson]] bought \"the Donovans' old house\".\n\nIn the episode \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", shortly before her death, Clyde's mother mentions that he has a sister, asking him to put the toilet seat down from now on for his sister's sake.\n\n===Surname===\nClyde's last name appeared on merchandise during the first few seasons as 'Clyde Goodman', but this name was never used on the show. During \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\", he was referred to as Clyde Donovan during a news segment, yet a few seasons later during \"[[Lice Capades]]\" the nurse asks him \"Clyde... Harris, is it?\" and while it may have been a mistake on her part, later airings corrected the line to Donovan. In \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\" on Facebook his name is changed back to 'Clyde Donovan'.\n\n==Interactions==\n===Craig Tucker===\n[[File:CrackBabyAthleticAssociation075.png|thumb|left|Craig and Clyde working for Cartman.]]\nClyde seems to get along with Craig quite well. He even seems to lead [[Craig's Gang]] from time to time, even though Craig is the confirmed leader. Normally, though, the two just hang around with each other. The two are often seen with each other, showing that they are likely good friends.\n\nClyde and Craig are seen together in a number of episodes, whether they are sitting next to each other or just talking to each other. In \"[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]\", they are seen working together for Cartman to look for [[Slash]]. In \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\", they play [[Texans vs. Mexicans]] on Cartman's side to prevent \"Mexicans\" from passing their border (which they, unfortunately, fail in doing). In [[Elementary School Musical]], they eat together in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]]. In \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\", they are cheer while watching Cartman and Wendy's fight.  In \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", Clyde hugs Craig when the rekindle their friendship. In \"[[Lice Capades]]\", Craig tells Clyde to bring a bar of soap and a sock to beat Kenny up. Because of this, many fans see them as best friends like Stan and Kyle.\n\nTheir names are sometimes mixed up as shown in \"[[Super Fun Time]]\" and they have nearly identical nasally voices. This was also noted in \"[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]\" when after you talk to Craig after he replaces Clyde as the owner of the armory, he will say he was given that role because the Grand Wizard Cartman said he sounds like Clyde, he denies that however.\n\nIn ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth|The Stick of Truth]]'', Craig joins Clyde's Army of Darkness as his second-in-command.\n\n===Token Black===\nToken and Clyde appear to be good friends. They are usually seen talking to each other in background scenes and both form the core of Craig's group.\n\n===Kyle Broflovski===\n[[File:TheList044.png|thumb|Clyde with Kyle.]] Clyde and Kyle get along well normally. In \"[[The List]]\" when Clyde had been voted the cutest boy in class and Kyle had been voted the ugliest, Clyde still tried to comfort Kyle - even though he was being a bit condescending at the time. However, Kyle did hurl abuse at Clyde during their sledding competition in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\" for being fat, although since he was replacing Cartman at the time, this was to be expected. In the episode \"[[A Boy And A Priest]]\", when Clyde is having his birthday party, he is seen talking with Kyle. Also on Clyde's birthday in the same episode, Kyle was sitting right next to him.\n\n===Eric Cartman===\n[[File:TheDeathofEricCartman (25).png|thumb|Clyde with Cartman.]] Clyde usually shows little or no interest in the antics of Cartman. However, he does join in from time to time, usually as a result of everyone else joining in as well - such as his leprechaun hunt in \"[[Imaginationland]]\", his membership of the superhero group [[Coon and Friends]]. There was one occasion when Clyde vehemently stood up for Cartman when Kyle and Stan failed to believe him in \"[[Marjorine]]\", which shocked everyone present. It is implied that Clyde is somewhat easy to manipulate as he does usually end up following Cartman's lead on his various schemes.\n\nThere are other times, though, when Clyde will be distracted from Cartman's schemes - when most of the 4th grade had been recruited to help take down [[Jenkins]] on World of Warcraft in \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\", Clyde was more interested in a Playboy magazine. He was a part of Cartman's pirate crew in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" and worked for Cartman in \"[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\" Clyde along with Stan, Kyle, Butters, Token, Craig and Jimmy smash all of Cartman's electronics due to them thinking that he is [[Skankhunt42]].\n\nAs of \"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\", Cartman appears to have forgiven Clyde as well as the boys for breaking his stuff, as he is no longer isolated from them rejoined their circle.\n\nIt appears that Cartman has a strong hatred for Clyde, as shown by his \"Shit List\" in \"[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole|The Fractured But Whole]]\" where he placed Clyde 3rd for his most hated person, after Kyle and [[Liane Cartman]] respectively.\n\n===Bebe Stevens===\n[[File:ClybePair-1-.png|thumb|Bebe with Clyde.]]In the episode \"[[Clubhouses]]\" Bebe has to break the news to Kyle that they can only be friends and then Bebe says \"Okay, let's go Clyde.\" Bebe also uses the corrupted list in \"[[The List]]\" to make Clyde popular, so that she can go out with him and justify getting free shoes from the shoe store that Clyde's dad owns at the [[South Park Mall]].\n\n===Red===\nIn \"[[The List]]\", after being placed at #1 on the girls' \"cutest boys\" list, Clyde briefly starts going out with Red before breaking up with her in favor of Bebe. Although Clyde seemed to have been romantically interested in her, it seems as though Red was only using him for the sake of getting free shoes, so it cannot be interpreted that she ''actually'' liked him.\n\n===Millie Larsen===\nClyde and Millie were paired up in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\". The two are often shown together at school assemblies, implying that they are relatively close friends.\n\n===Lisa Berger===\nAfter seeing a photoshopped image of Lisa going from overweight to beautiful, Clyde starts dating her, believing that her appearance actually transformed to how she is depicted in said photoshopped image. The two are shown to be rather appreciative of one another's company.\n\nClyde is seen crying after a recent breakup in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", although whether this was with Lisa or someone else is unknown.\n\n===Annie Knitts===\nThey have not been seen together much, other than in the background at the school dance in \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\". Additionally, Annie also kindly greets Clyde as he confidentially walks down the hallway after becoming the most popular boy at school.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" a kid looks like Clyde but with blonde hair.\n*[[Francis]] is seen wearing Clyde's clothes in \"[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\".\n*[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] mentions in \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\" that Clyde has only one testicle, though this was likely a mere rumor, produced in an attempt to boost the news show's ratings.\n* In the episode \"[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]\" his favorite food was revealed to be tacos.\n*Clyde is right-handed.\n*In Dr. Shay's commercial in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", a boy who resembles Clyde is seen crying.\n*In \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", Clyde's birthday is revealed to be April 10.\n*In \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", Clyde's Facebook status is; \"im da man, and you're not\".\n*In \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", Clyde gets raped by one of the whores.\n*In \"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\", Clyde has a much higher voice than usual.\n*While Clyde is normally voiced by [[Trey Parker]], his whizzy Mosquito voice in the Superhero Arc was done by [[Matt Stone]].\n*In \"[[Cripple Fight]]\", a boy who looks like Clyde with blond hair is seen sitting among the boy scouts.\n*Clyde is the only member of [[Coon and Friends]] who is not voiced by his original voice actor.\n*Clyde is the only kid with three Fantasy-themed costumes, which are Warrior and Lord of Darkness from ''The Stick of Truth'' game and Dwarf King in ''Phone Destroyer''.\n\n==Prominence==\nClyde was originally used as a background character, and served as one of the first recurring background characters alongside [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. In [[Season Four]], he was given a lasting personality and gradually became one of the primary members of [[the boys]]' class in [[Season Six]] and onward. He is sometimes overshadowed by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] or [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], whom he is shown to be close friends with. He has notably spoken in multiple episodes in every season to date, as well as [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the movie]] and several video games.\n[[File:ClydesDebut.jpg|thumb|right|Clyde's debut.]]\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Seen in Mr. Garrison's classroom for the first time.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - Seen in Mr. Garrison's classroom.\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" - Clyde's first speaking role in the show; he questions what role he'll be playing in the South Park play.\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - His dog, [[Rex]], gets raped by Stan's dog, [[Sparky]].\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Clyde is the only person who claps for [[Kevin Stoley|Casey]]'s weed.\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Clyde's parents get a call from [[Sheila Broflovski|Kyle's mother]] for letting Clyde watch Terrance and Phillip.\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - Clyde gets bitten by zombie Kenny and turns into another zombie.

They ask him to help but he tells them he does not care. In gameplay, he is of the same class as [[Stan Marsh]], [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Jimmy Valmer]], doing average damage, speed, and range, and his special ability involves tossing his [[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce|colostomy bag]] out and causing damage to enemies within a small radius.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nClyde appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as the secondary antagonist of the game.\n\nClyde first appears as a member of the Kingdom of Kupa Keep as a warrior under the rule of Eric Cartman. Clyde is the first person that fights with the player to learn the battle mechanics. After the elves invade the kingdom, Clyde informs that they have taken the stick, which he was supposed to guard. As a result of this, Cartman banishes him \"from space and time\", preventing him from playing with them, and he angrily leaves.\n\nClyde is not seen again until the end of the battle of humans against elves. After they discover the Stick was not at the school, they find a message that leads them to Clyde's locker, where they find a laptop that is in a video call with him. Clyde reveals that he is in possession of the Stick and has formed a new army to get revenge at his friends for kicking him out of the game. Clyde also reveals that he has a barrel containing green goo, which he uses to turn animals into Nazi Zombies soldiers. The boys go to his house but their attack fails as they are outnumbered and all the boys are sent to their houses due to being past their curfew.\n\nAfter Kyle's army has greatly grown in number, they launch an assault to Clyde's fortress. When they get to his throne room, Clyde uses the goo to revive [[Chef]] as a Nazi Zombie. After he is defeated, Clyde surrenders. Cartman takes back the Stick, and kicks him off the treehouse to the ground.\n\nClyde's personality in the game is one of a power-hungry dark lord after he is banished by Cartman. He is also apparently not very discerning when it comes to the use of the green goo. While he is effective in using it to create a Nazi Zombie army, he firmly believes the Government's cover story that it is Taco Bell green sauce, and attributes its strange properties to its ingredients.\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"120\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nClydeadvcard.png|'''Hookhand Clyde'''\nClydescicard.png|'''Alien Clyde'''\nClydemyscard.png|'''Hercules Clyde'''\nClydefancard.png|'''Dwarf King Clyde'''\nClydeSupCard.png|'''Mosquito'''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Children}} \n[[de:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[es:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[fr:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[it:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[ja:クライド・ドノヴァン]]\n[[nl:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[pl:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[pt-br:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[ru:Клайд Донован]]\n[[tr:Clyde Donovan]]\n[[zh:克莱德·多诺万]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! playable characters]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Supporting characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with changed names]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: KKK Members]]\n[[Category:Lil' Qties]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]"
