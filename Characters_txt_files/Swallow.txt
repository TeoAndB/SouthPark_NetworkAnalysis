Though it does not play a very large role in any of its appearances, Seaman can be heard talking to it a few times. In \"[[201]]\", when [[Jesus Christ]] tells Seaman and Swallow to go get some sushi for dinner, he leaves and says \"Swallow, come!\" causing the other Super Best Friends to burst out laughing due to the dirty-sounding line.\n\nLike Seaman, Swallow appears to be capable of breathing underwater without drowning.\n\n==Appearance==\nSwallow has white and gray feathers as well as small black claws. It wears a teal bandana around its eyes.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Swallow\">\nSeaman-and-Swallow-SBF.png|Swallow and Seaman in \"[[Super Best Friends]]\".\nSeaman-and-Swallow-201.png|Swallow and Seaman in \"[[201]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Super Best Friends]]\"\n*\"[[200]]\"\n*\"[[201]]\"\n[[zh:海燕]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Super Best Friends]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
