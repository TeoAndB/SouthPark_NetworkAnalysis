Then they go to his house and find out what a great army he had. Two of the Bully Girls were in the army while the middle one was absent.\n\nThe last appearance of the Bully Girls is in the final mission of the game \"[[Beat Up Clyde]]\". The third girl is seen at the beginning of the mission fighting a 4th grader in the background and the second girl is seen above Clyde Fort with a Cyclops costume boy, the New Kid will have to defeat her and him to pass. The three are seen fainting in the backyard along with the entire army when [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is defeated.\n\n==Appearance==\nBully girls are taller than 4th graders.

This is the first time one of them has been seen in an episode.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the game files they are called \"bully_rhat\", \"bullyhood\" and \"bullyband\".\n*There is an unused character model in the game files called just \"bullygirl\". It is possible that this character would appear together with these three girls or could be just the beta of one of them. The character model bears a great resemblance to [[Tammy Warner]]. The character's head and hair are missing from the files.\n[[fr:Bully Girls]]\n[[zh:女恶霸]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:6th graders]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Enemies]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]"
