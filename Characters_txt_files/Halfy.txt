In his early appearances, he would claim that he would have sex with various things/people, only to be told, \"You don't count Halfy, you don't have any legs\", to which he would reply, \"Oh. Yeah.\"\n\nHalfy can be spotted at the starting line of the South Park \"Running of the Cows\" in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Cow Days]]\". He appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", singing, \"''I'm a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock and roll''\".\n\nHalfy finally makes another appearance, in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\", after a long absence from the show. In this episode, he is seen celebrating the end of the pandemic with other citizens.\n\n==Appearance==\nHalfy has long, messy brown hair, an equally messy beard, and thick, brown eyebrows. He wears a green shirt and rolled up, brown pants, that are possibly sealed at the knee. In \"I'm a Little Bit Country\", he wears a yellow ribbon near his right shoulder. In \"''[[South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut]]''\" he used a wheelchair and had a mustache instead of a beard.\n\n==Personality==\nHe seems to want to attract attention by blaming himself for things that others would not be proud of, for example in \"[[Chickenlover]]\", he admitted that he would have sex with a chicken. He also seems to be insecure about his amputations, becoming upset when [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] told him \"You couldn't screw anything! You don't have any legs!\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Judging by his looks, he may be a reference to Lt. Dan Taylor from the 1994 film ''Forrest Gump''.\n**Despite his distinctive appearance, he is still sometimes modified or recolored to represent other characters:\n**In \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\", [[Sheila Broflovski]] read the boys a book about freaks. On the cover page, a man who looks exactly like Halfy, only with grey hair, can be seen.\n**In [[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]], he has blonde hair even though his beard is still brown.\n*When he is happy, he jumps into the air and does somersaults.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\"- First speaking role.\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\"\n*\"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" - A man resembling Halfy is seen on the cover of the book Sheila is reading to the boys.\n*\"[[Cow Days]]\"\n*\"''[[South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut]]''\" - Halfy makes a small appearance on [[Big Gay Al]]'s music.\n*\"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\" - Seen in the crowd scene at the end.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\"- Seen singing  \"''I'm a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock and roll''\".\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==Video Games==\n[[File:Halfy.png|thumb|The poster of Halfy missing]]\nIn ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', there is a 'missing' poster in the [[Park County Police Station]] depicting Halfy, revealing that he is 43 years old and has brown eyes, using an image of him from \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", his last appearance in the show at the time. This seemed to be a reference to his long absence from the series; he has since reappeared in the \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[ja:ハーフィー]]\n[[zh:瘸子]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]\n[[Category:Characters with changed names]]"
