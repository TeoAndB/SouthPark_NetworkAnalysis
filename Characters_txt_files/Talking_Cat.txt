"{{South Park character\n|name = Talking Cat\n|image = Celebritites-internet-oh-long-johnson-cat.png\n|race = Feline\n|hair = Black; White\n|job = Internet celebrity\n|appearance = \"[[Faith Hilling]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Talking Cat''' appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, \"[[Faith Hilling]]\", where it was declared to be the cause behind the \"[[List of Memes#\"Oh Long Johnsoning\"|Oh Long Johnson]]\" meme. The talking cat was made famous by a YouTube video and a footage from that video was used in the episode.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the death of a teenager occurred after \"Oh Long Johnsoning\" at a batting cage, the talking cat was cited to be the cause of the meme. The cat was eventually arrested and caged up. [[Professor Lamont]] was sent to the facility where the cat was being held to reason with it, but was unsuccessful, as he interpreted the cat's vocalizations as a refusal to stop memeing.\n\nThis, eventually, lead to some believing that cats had evolved into beings as intelligent as humans. The [[Ambassador of Humans]] was sent in to try to communicate with the cat, who also interpreted the cat's vocalizations as a declaration of war, that the cats will continue to evolve and rise in power, that cats and humans cannot coexist, and \"Oh Don Piano\".\n\nThe cat is later present at the [[Colorado Republican Debate (2012)]] to debate against [[Mitt Romney]], [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Newt Gingrich]].\n\n==Appearance==\nThe talking cat is a black cat with patches of white fur.\n\n==See Also==\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acRpBTAfQSI YouTube Video] where the footage of the cat was used.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n{{InternetCelebrities}}\n[[zh:会说话的猫]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Internet celebrities]]\n[[Category:Realistic characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
