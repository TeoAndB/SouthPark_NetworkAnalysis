He first appeared in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", where he bursted into the courtroom as the [[Hoffman and Turk Attorney|attorney]] from [[Hoffman and Turk Law Offices]] performed a \"sue-ance\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Clyde Donovan]]'s mother [[Betsy Donovan|Betsy]] died, [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] set out to help him sue Sir John Harington. Upon arrival to Hoffman and Turk Law Offices, they learned that they could sue the dead with a \"sue-ance\". Although their initial \"sue-ances\" were unsuccessful, Harington does appear before the county court to demonstrate the proper use of a toilet. Just as what [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] mentions in class, Sir Harington advised everyone that the proper way to sit on a toilet was to face the toilet bowl, as to use it as a shelf for books, quills, and ink.\n\n==Appearance==\nSir Harington wears formal attire, consisting of black shoes, light gray pants, a white blouse, a black colonial-style coat, and a brown belt. He has dark brown hair, a brown beard, and a long mustache. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Sir John Harington\">\nReverseCowgirl079.png|John Harington demonstrating the proper way to sit on a toilet in \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n[[es:Sir John Harington]]\n[[zh:约翰·哈林顿]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Historical celebrities]]"
