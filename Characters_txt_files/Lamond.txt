The Musical]]\". He owns a feat-performing turkey named [[Alinicia]].\n\n==Background==\n[[The 4th Grade|the 4th graders]] are rehearsing for their [[The Miracle Worker|Thanksgiving play]] about Helen Keller. They are trying to put on a play as spectacular as possible, and decide to being in a turkey that can do tricks to fit with the Thanksgiving theme. [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] brings in [[Gobbles]], a disabled turkey, whom the kids feel is useless to them. Lamond answers their supervisor [[Jeffrey Maynard]]'s call to bring in his feat-performing turkey, Alinicia. However, Alinicia refuses to perform with another turkey and throws a fit. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] does not know what to do, so Lamond tells him to kill Gobbles in an \"unfortunate accident\". However Cartman accidentally gets [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] killed instead.\n\nLamond comes up with another idea. He lies to Timmy that an animal shelter is going to take Gobbles away from him and torture it, and the only way to prevent that is for Timmy to let Gobbles go into the wild. He even falsely claims the workers installing water effects at the play are the animal shelter workers coming to get Gobbles. Timmy believes him and reluctantly lets Gobbles go. However, during the play, he finds out that the workers are here to install the water effects, meaning Lamond had tricked him. He rushes off to find Gobbles. When he returns, he gets his revenge by ordering [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and his hunting buddies to shoot Alinicia, leaving Lamond in despair.\n\n==Appearance==\nLamond has closely cropped greenish gray hair and a beard and moustache. He has sunken cheeks, a wrinkled forehead and a hook nose, and wears glasses. He is usually scowling. He wears a red scarf and a long dark gray coat over a pink and black striped sweater and teal trousers.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is very mean, treacherous, and selfish. He devises several schemes to get rid of Gobbles to ensure that his turkey, Alinicia, will be the only star at the Thanksgiving play.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[zh:拉蒙德]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
