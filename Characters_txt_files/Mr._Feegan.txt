Shelly gets into a confrontation with Mr. Feegan when she suggests letting Larry decide for himself if he wants to be a vegan. Larry is obviously afraid of his parents, not daring to speak up to them, and waves at Shelly to keep going. She suggests that having a nice steak once in a while might prevent Larry from being bullied at school. This makes Mr. Feegan very angry and he argues with her. In turn, Larry sees this as an act of bravery and begins trying to win the acceptance of Shelly.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a bully who is fanatical about veganism.

He appears tanned and muscular. He wears a navy blue polo tee and navy blue track pants, both of which have white stripes on either side. He wears navy blue slider flip flops with white stripes. [[Mrs. Feegan|His wife]] wears the same shirt and flip flops as him. Like the rest of his family, he wears an orange life vest around his neck at all times to prevent drowning; indicating that they are probably survivalists.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[ja:ミスター・フィーガン]]\n[[zh:费根先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
