"{{South Park character\n|name = Tooth Decay\n|image = Tooth-decay.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Atonkatok\n|died = \"[[Royal Pudding]]\"\n|job = Monster, Kidnapper, Murderer\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1913934/|title=\"Royal Pudding\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Royal Pudding]]\"\n}}\n'''Tooth Decay''' is a monstrous being who appeared in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", where he appears as the main antagonist. He is a literally monstrous portrayal of the condition tooth decay, the breaking down of teeth due to acids created by bacteria.\n\n==Background==\nHe kidnapped the [[Prince and Princess of Canada|princess]], and all the Canadians rose up to try to save her in a state of national emergency. [[Scott the Dick]], [[Ike Broflovski]], [[Ugly Bob]] and some Eskimos manage to find the princess. Ike kills Tooth Decay using Bob's ugliness, turning him into stone and saving the princess.\n\nIn the kindergarten play, while Ike is absent, [[Kyle Broflovski]] is forced to play the role of Tooth Decay, and [[Mr. Mackey]] is very disappointed by his lackluster performance. Making the play was a cathartic experience for Mr. Mackey, who lost his [[Mr. Mackey Senior|father]] to Tooth Decay several years ago.\n\n==Appearance==\nTooth Decay appears as a terrifying huge green monster covered in spikes, with glowing yellow eyes. \n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Tooth Decay\">\nRoyalPudding023.png|[[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] as Tooth Decay in the play.\nRoyalPudding075.png|[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] replaces his absent brother in the play.\nRoyalPudding083.png|Tooth Decay turned into stone.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*When Tooth Decay sees Ugly Bob's face, it turns to stone, but when [[Terrance and Phillip]] see Bob's face in \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\" they are not affected.\n*His death is a parody of the Greek mythological figure Perseus, who apparently showed the decapitated head of the Gorgon Medusa to the Kraken, turning it into stone.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:La Carie]]\n[[zh:蛀牙]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]"
