"{{South Park character\n|name = Brimmy\n|image = Boy with blue cap.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Caucasian\n|age = 9-10\n|job = Student\n|grade = [[The 4th Grade|4th Grade]]\n|voice = [[Matt Stone]]\n|appearance = \"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\"\n|speaking = ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''\n}}\n'''Brimmy''' is a [[The 4th Grade|4th grader]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. He has remained a background character since the first season and still appears often in the show, though he has never spoken within the series and has no known personality.\n\n==Background==\nA classmate of [[the boys]]' since the third grade, he has appeared as a background character numerous times throughout the show, especially in hallway scenes and on the playground. His invitation to [[Eric Cartman]]'s birthday party in \"[[Damien]]\" was one of his most visible appearances. He only appeared in the classroom in \"[[Gnomes]]\" briefly when the kids were separated into groups.\n\nHis most notable appearance may be \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", where he was a voiceless participant in a riot against the fake [[Mr. Hankey]] in the Nebraska mall and committed a number of serious crimes in the process. (see below)\n\nHe has never spoken unique dialogue in the series itself, however he did let out a short grunt of pain after being hit by a dodgeball in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" and can be seen yelling ''\"Yeah!\"'' in \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\" among a large crowd of kids.\n\nHe made his first true speaking appearance in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' as one of the various boys inside Raisins. His voice sounds somewhere between [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s voices. This was also where his name was revealed as Brimmy, which was first coined by fans in the show's early seasons.\n\nIn \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\", he appears in a different classroom with a number of other background fourth graders.\n\n===Criminal Record===\n*'''Assault and battery:''' He is seen beating up one of the mall employees with a [[Mr. Hankey]] toy in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\"\n*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' Participant in the riot of children at the Nebraska mall in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\"\n*'''Arson:''' Throws a lit Molotov cocktail at the Lollyland step up in the Nebraska mall in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\n*'''Vandalism''': Spray paints the walls of the Nebraska mall in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\n*'''Shoplifting/breaking and entering''': In \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", he, along with two other kids, throws a bench at the window of an electronics store in the mall, and steals the store's items without paying for them.\n*'''Indecent exposure:''' Participant in the \"Wieners Out\" movement formed by [[Butters Stotch]], which involves boys walking down the hallway of [[South Park Elementary]] showing their genitalia.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Isla]]===\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", Isla breaks up with Brimmy due to the conflict between the boys and the girls, which confirms that they were \"dating\".\n\nIn \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\", they appear to be in the same classroom separate from the main characters.\n\n==Appearance==\nBrimmy wears a blue coat and grey trousers, and most prominently a blue cap with a bright yellow brim. Several other unnamed background characters can be seen with similar appearances to Brimmy, having different colored clothing. His coat is similar to that worn by [[Craig Tucker]] and the [[Girl with Blonde Hair]]; his hat is also similar in shape to [[Stan Marsh]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Brimmy\">\nBoy with blue cap with red.png|Brimmy with [[Red]].\nBlue boy.png|Brimmy's icon in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' (scrapped).\nBrim1.PNG|Brimmy in the episode Dodgeball about to get hit with a ball.\nBrimmyonCoonstagram.png|\"You totally caught me waiting for my girlfriend.

The name Brimmy originated among fans around the show's early seasons; he was known at this wiki as '''Boy With Blue Cap''' from 2012 until the release of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\n==Prominence==\n*''[[The Unaired Pilot]]''\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\"\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\"\n*\"[[Damien]]\"\n*\"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\"\n*\"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\"\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\"\n*\"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\"\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\"\n*\"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" - Multiple duplicates are seen with the kids in Nebraska.\n*\"[[Gnomes]]\" - In the third grade classroom sitting next to [[Pip Pirrip]] and [[Token Black]].\n*\"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" \n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]\"\n*\"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\"\n*\"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\"\n*\"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]\"\n*\"[[Fourth Grade]]\"\n*\"[[Trapper Keeper]]\"\n*\"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\"\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Seen in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria]].\n*\"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\"\n*\"[[Toilet Paper]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\"\n*\"[[Casa Bonita]]\"\n*\"[[Douche and Turd]]\"\n*\"[[You Got F'd in the A]]\" - Briefly seen eating at [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]].\n*\"[[Quest for Ratings]]\"\n*\"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" - Seen being chased by [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] at her \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" party.\n*\"[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\"\n*\"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\" - Seen in the [[South Park Elementary Playground|playground]].\n*\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\" - Seen in the hallway and in the gymnasium.\n*\"[[D-Yikes!]]\" - Seen leaving the school.\n*\"[[Night of the Living Homeless]]\"\n*\"[[The List]]\"\n*\"[[Canada on Strike]]\"\n*\"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" - Seen watching the fight between Wendy and Cartman.\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\"\n*\"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\"\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria and the hallway.\n*\"[[City Sushi]]\" - Seen in assembly.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Seen at the assembly.\n*\"[[Faith Hilling]]\" - Seen in the memeing class with the other [[The 4th Grade|fourth grade]] students.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in the background in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" - Seen in the background in the school's hallways.\n*\"[[Raising the Bar]]\" - Seen during the \"[[Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo]]\" video.\n*\"[[Going Native]]\" - Seen eating in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[A Scause For Applause]]\" - Seen in the background in the school hallways.\n*\"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]\" - Seen eating in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\" - Seen in [[Park County Community Center]].\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" - Seen in the school hallways.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\"- Briefly seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen in the school cafeteria and [[Isla|his girlfriend]] breaks up with him.\n*\"[[Wieners Out]]\" - Seen participating in Butters' Wieners Out movement.\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen in the battle between the boys and the girls.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Holiday Special]]\" - Seen in the hallway rioting due to a cancellation of Columbus Day, and seen in the crowd.\n*\"[[Moss Piglets]]\" - Seen in the school hallway.\n*\"[[The Problem with a Poo]]\" - Seen in the school assembly.\n*\"[[Shots|Shots!!]]\" - Seen on the [[Main Street]] when [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] is celebrating.\n*\"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria and at the assembly.\n*\"[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Board Girls]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Basic Cable]]\" - Seen in the school bus.\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Seen in quarantine at school with the other students and in a different class.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nHe can be found in the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] restaurant and [[The New Kid]] can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Cyborg|cyborg]] ability.\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[es:Brimmy]]\n[[fr:Brimmy]]\n[[ja:ブリミー]]\n[[zh:布里密]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
