Lisa also appeared in \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" in the background when [[Token Black]] was pushing his at-the-time girlfriend [[Nichole Daniels]] on the swing.\n\nShe was a prime focus in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[The Hobbit]]\", where she is now named Lisa Berger.\n\n==Appearance==\nLisa has messy brown hair. She wears orange pants, a purple shirt, white socks, and black shoes. She's also overweight and has a noticeable overbite. Her pants are worn above the waist. She has red freckles on her face and also wears yellow glasses.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Butters Stotch]]===\nLisa has a crush on Butters in \"[[The Hobbit]]\". While the other girls tease her for it, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] encourages her to privately ask him out. Taking her advice, Lisa approaches Butters in the cafeteria and asks him out to go see a movie. While Butters appreciates her kindness, he rejects her on grounds that he's turned off by her weight, much to Lisa's disappointment.\n\nHowever, Butters later feels sorry for rejecting Lisa after seeing a photoshopped image of her class photo done by Wendy as a means to demonstrate the attractiveness methods that celebrities like [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]] use to affect the male population. As a result, he is eager to go out with Lisa and win her heart, only to find out that Clyde has started dating her, to Butters' jealousy.\n\n===[[Clyde Donovan]]===\nAfter seeing a photoshopped image of Lisa going from overweight to beautiful, Clyde starts dating her, believing that her appearance actually transformed into how she's depicted in said photoshopped image. The two are shown to be rather appreciative of one another's company.\n\n===[[Wendy Testaburger]]===\nWendy appears to be great friends with Lisa, always willing to help her out in bad situations and defend her from those picking on her. They first interact in \"[[The Hobbit]]\", when they are part of the South Park Cows Cheerleading Squad. As the girls announce their names while doing Cheer Squad roll call, Lisa's voice comes out quietly and shyly as opposed to the other girls. This leads the girls to be dissatisfied with her presence and demanding that they do one without Lisa.\n\nWendy defends her, boosting her self-esteem by encouraging her to show off her sassiness to boys. The other girls reveal that Lisa has a crush on Butters and starts teasing her because of it. Angered from their bullying, Wendy advises her to ask him out. After Butters rejects her, Wendy angrily confronts him, stating that Lisa is very nice and therefore he should care more about her personality rather than her appearance.\n\nHowever, she later angrily calls Lisa \"ugly and fat\" after Butters excessively goes on about how hot he finds her after viewing the photoshopped image Wendy made of her, though she feels regretful for saying so after realizing that Lisa heard what she said.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen being made fun of by the [[Bucky Bailey]] at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" - Seen in the background on the playground eating.\n*\"[[World War Zimmerman]]\" - Seen performing as a cheerleader at the school assembly.\n*\"[[The Hobbit]]\" - Becomes the most popular girl in school, and [[Clyde Donovan]]'s girlfriend, after Wendy uses Photoshop to \"improve\" her appearance, despite doing so to try and prove a negative point to [[Butters Stotch]] about its deceptive effects.\n*\"[[Board Girls]]\" - Seen playing at the Board Girls Gaming Club.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nLisa can be seen leaving detention after [[Douchebag]] opens the door, but she does not appear elsewhere and cannot be befriended.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n\n[[pl:Lisa Berger]]\n[[es:Lisa Berger]]\n[[zh:丽莎·伯格]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Female 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Nerds]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]"
