She is, arguably, the third-most prominent female character in fourth grade, behind [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. She sits at the front of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s class, usually to the far right. Red is one of \"the popular girls\" in the fourth grade. She is almost always shown with the other popular girls like [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Annie Knitts|Annie]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], [[Lola]], and others.\n\nShe went twenty-three seasons of being known only as \"Red\" despite being in the show since [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|the start]]. Her full name was revealed in \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nRed's hair is a mirrored version of [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s, although it is red and slightly shorter. She is also very similar to [[Sally Turner]]; they both have similar color schemes and have similar voices. In the earlier seasons, she wore a purple jacket with dark blue pants. In the later seasons, she wears a navy blue jacket with buttons and mauve trimming at the top instead, mauve gloves, and navy blue pants (which are the colors of Wendy Testaburger's jacket reversed).\n\nIn \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\", she was shown to be wearing a violet jacket (similar to Wendy Testaburger's) with tan trimming and matching mittens while on the bus with [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]].\n\nIn \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", when she was dressed as a \"stupid spoiled whore\", Red wore a violet bolero jacket with brown fur trim, an orange string bikini top, a denim miniskirt, fishnet stockings, and teal boots with trimmed fur. She also had pink blush on her face, teal eyeshadow, pink lipstick, and her hair were very glossy. During the whore-off scene, she wore a pair of violet gloves mainly because the outside was cold.\n\nWhen dressed for the sleepover in \"[[Marjorine]]\" she wore a golden-yellow, green button-down top with a blue and white striped lace collar and pajama pants.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Red McArthur}}\n\n==Personality==\nRed has played a modest role as a part of Wendy's gang. She has been portrayed as the more confrontational of the girls at times, as demonstrated when she called [[Marjorine (Character)|Marjorine]] a geek and said: \"she'd live alone for the rest of her life\" at [[Heidi Turner]]'s [[Marjorine|sleepover]], and when she warned Wendy about [[The List|the corrupted list of the cutest boys at South Park Elementary]].\n\nRed can also be benevolent at times; in some episodes she has been kind to many people and engaging in friendly conversations, for example, in \"[[Erection Day]]\" she kindly greets [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] when he comes to talk to her, but when she hears him say that he wants to have sex with her she becomes very disgusted with him and slaps him. Also, she hasn't been afraid to stand up for others: in \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\", Red and Lola rush to Butters' defense after the four boys criticize him for taking the credit for writing the title book.\n\nA trait of courage was shown in \"[[Marjorine]]\" when the girls did \"Light as a feather, stiff as a board\", when Red volunteered to go first. This is a very spiritual activity and when Marjorine (Butters) saw them doing this he screamed and accused them of being witches.\n\nShe has also been shown to like to party, like in \"[[Marjorine]]\" where she was shown dancing to the new [[Justin Timberlake]] CD with her friends after they gave Marjorine ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) a make-over. She was also shown in \"[[Douche and Turd]]\" and \"[[The Hobbit]]\" that she was on the school cheerleading squad along with some other girls.\n\nIn \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", an episode of [[Season Six|season six]], she was given a prominent speaking role, saying more than a word or two than her speaking debut in \"[[Damien]]\". In this episode, [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] brought up that she couldn't stand Bebe anymore. The girls begin talking nastily about [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]. Red then says: \"You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.\" After this she didn't speak until [[Season Eight|season eight]] in \"[[The Jeffersons]]\" where she says two words. Later in season eight, in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" she spoke even more sufficiently. After this season, primarily \"Stupid Spoiled Whore Playset\", Red was considered as a secondary character. In [[Season Nine|season nine]] she played an important role in \"[[Marjorine]]\" where she was one of the girls at [[Heidi Turner]]'s sleepover. In \"[[Erection Day]]\" she speaks again to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]. Her role has been gradually increasing since this. Before, people used to recognize her simply as the red-haired girl who was seen in the background of many episodes.\n\n[[File:Spgirls.png|left|thumb|Wendy, Lola, and Red, being approached by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]].]]\n\nRed has been shown to be one of the very popular girls in the grade. She may even be more popular than Wendy or Bebe. In many different episodes, she has been shown in the background with many different girls. In the older episodes, she was shown in almost every episode, being followed by boys, which could be suggesting that she is also very pretty and attractive. Also when [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] became aware that he was the cutest boy in the class in \"[[The List]]\", the first person he asked out was Red. In \"[[Erection Day]]\", when [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] found out he had to have sex with someone to stop having his erection problems, the first person he went to was Red. In \"[[Sarcastaball]]\", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] has a dream about Red and Wendy kissing him in an ice cream parlor; in said dream, as Wendy shows affection towards him, Red jealously says \"Leave him alone, Wendy. He's mine!\" and the two then proceed to kiss him, causing Butters to wake up and ejaculate, another sign of Red's popularity with boys. Also in \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] paid all of the girls to go crazy for their music video, he chose Red and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] to hug and rub him over all of the other girls, there-again, showing that Red is one of the cutest girls in the grade.\n\nRed has also expressed jealousy, anger, and sadness. In \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", she is shown gossiping about Bebe with Wendy and the other girls. In \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\", she is seen as disheartened and insecure, saying \"I'd give anything to be with [[Bridon Gueermo]], but he'd never go out with me. I'm nobody.\"\n\n===Commercialism===\nIn \"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\", Red is shown in the [[Cheesy Poofs]] commercial that [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] was supposed to be in. During the episode, Cartman was bragging to the third-grade class (which they were in at the time) about how he won the competition and how he was going to be in the Cheesy Poofs commercial. Everyone was jealous of Cartman but Red must have been selected to be in the commercial by the company. She was actually shown more in the commercial than Cartman was.\n\n===Criminal Record===\n*'''Assault:''' In \"[[Erection Day]]\", she slaps [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] in response to the latter's request to have sex with her. Although, it was done out of self-defense, but since Jimmy is handicapped it could still be considered a crime against the disabled.\n*'''Civil unrest/rioting:''' In \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", Red is one of the many kids rioting at the Nebraska mall. She is a participant of the South Park Elementary gender war in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\".\n*'''Drug abuse:''' In \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\", Red is seen getting high on cough syrup in the girls' restroom.\n*'''Graft:''' She, along with numerous other girls on the South Park Girls' List Committee, altered the list of cutest boys so that Clyde would be on the top, in order to get free shoes from him. This is graft, because Red abused her authority for personal gain.\n*'''Sexual harassment:''' She is one of the many girls participating in Bebe's sex party in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", making unwanted sexual advancements to the male attendants.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Stan Marsh]]===\nIn \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", at Bebe's party, she held [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] down and tried to kiss him. This was most likely because all the girls were acting like whores during the episode. Aside from the aforementioned instance, they have not interacted one-on-one. However, in \"[[Butterballs]]\", after Stan voiced his dissatisfaction over bullying, Red congratulated him, saying \"at least someone in this school has some balls.\"\n\n===[[Bridon Gueermo]]===\nIn \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\", she had a crush on [[Bridon Gueermo]], as did the rest of [[List of Female 4th Graders|the girls]], and says that she would give anything to be with Bridon, after [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] brings up that she saw him at the movies seeing ''High School Musical 3''. But then she points out that he would never go for her because she is, in her words, nobody. [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] tells her that it's not true and then breaks into song.\n\n===[[Clyde Donovan]]===\nIn \"[[The List]]\", it was revealed that Red was dating Clyde, but this was only because of the girls' plot to get free shoes from him. So we can not say that she actually \"liked\" him, especially because on the real list that one fan calculated, [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] was listed number thirteen, meaning that he was one of the bottom five cutest guys in the class.\n\n===[[Jimmy Valmer]]===\nIt appeared in \"[[Erection Day]]\" that Red may have had a bit of a liking for Jimmy when he approached her, she seemed really friendly and a bit shy, however, this turned right around after [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] asked her immediately to have sex with her. She then slapped him, called him a jerk, and walked away disgusted with him.\n\n===[[Butters Stotch]]===\nRed's first interaction with Butters in \"[[Marjorine]]\" was a rather unpleasant one, as previously discussed; however, she was quick to defend him against the boys in \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\", telling them not to pick on Butters because he was, as she put it, \"a very fragile artist.\" Their relationship however, is currently unknown, as the two haven't recently interacted. However, due to the gender war that separated the boys and girls in school throughout [[Season Twenty]], she can be heard shouting \"All boys should die!\" in the crowd of Butters and [[Nelly]]'s fight in \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\", implying her disapproval of said gender war that Butters started by forming the \"Wieners Out\" movement.\n\n===[[Craig Tucker]]===\nCraig and Red are paired together in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\". Like the other children, they seem to greatly enjoy one another's company during the project. Craig and Red are also seen together throughout \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\", are in the children's choir together in \"[[The City Part of Town]]\", and sit next to each other on the bus in \"[[Basic Cable]]\".\n\n===[[Annie Knitts]]===\nRed and [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] have appeared together in the background from early on, though it's become more common to see them together in the more recent seasons, implying that the two may have a close friendship like that of [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]'s but Red has also been shown being followed by many boys and girls, showing that she is very popular and has many good friends. And still, of all these appearances, she has been shown with [[Annie Knitts|Annie]] the most.\n\n===[[Kevin Stoley]]===\nIn the earlier seasons, Red was often shown in the background with [[Kevin]], usually hanging out or at lunch. The two were even shown to be trading sandwiches in \"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\". They also appeared together at Cartman's party in \"[[Damien]]\" and held hands while singing \"[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]\". They were seen at the movies together watching ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\n\nIn addition, Kevin is seen looking sad at the dance in \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" right near Red, who is dancing with [[Token Black|Token]], implying that he might have wanted to dance with her instead. They are also seen sitting next to each other on the bus in \"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\", chatting before class starts in \"[[Gnomes]]\", and playing instruments in a band together in \"[[Summer Sucks]]\". Red is also shown as one of the girls hitting on Kevin as he walks by in the hallway in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\n\nAround the fourth season, the lunch room's design began changing as the main boys were more often seen with other children, and the two were no longer regularly shown together. In addition, newer episodes such as \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" and \"[[Fatbeard]]\", portray Kevin as a geek with an obsession of ''Star Wars'', and Red is shown to be one of the popular girls in the school. As Red's role in the series has gradually increased, Kevin's has remained the same save for a major role in \"Fatbeard\".\n\n[[File:SkankHunt00037.png|thumb|Red breaking up with Kevin in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\"]]\nThe two had not been shown together with a few exceptions, such as \"[[Lice Capades]]\", in class in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" and arguably \"[[Super Fun Time]]\".\n\nIt was revealed in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\" that they were in a relationship prior to their breakup. Kevin is devastated by their abrupt breakup and he can be seen weeping in the hallway while looking at Red's note at the end of the episode.\n\n===[[Token Black]]===\nToken and Red attended the dance together in \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\". Like most of her relationships however, this one is unknown, as she hasn't recently interacted with him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[The Hobbit]]\", Red was the only one who was not insulted by [[Wendy Testaburger]].\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" was the only episode when she was called by \"Bertha\".\n*Red is currently the only girl who has been in advertising, as she appeared in the Cheesy Poofs commercial more than [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] did.\n*Despite being called Red, Bertha, and Rebecca, she was insulted by Eric in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", and was called, \"Whatever your name is.\" She was called, \"Red\" again in \"Elementary School Musical\", even though she was previously called, \"Rebecca\" in \"[[The List]]\".\n*She is the ex-girlfriend of classmate [[Kevin Stoley]].\n*Red's hair also resembles that of [[Carol McCormick|Carol]]'s hair.\n*Red was seen sitting next to [[Skeeter]] in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\", which made people think she was his daughter. However, Red was seen with different parents in [[The Pandemic Special]], so it is likely that her being shown with Skeeter was a continuity error.\n*Red is shown to be a fan of Justin Timberlake, as she brought over one of his albums to [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s sleepover in \"[[Marjorine]]\".\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''===\nRed plays no role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and is one of the 'additional characters' unlocked at the game's completion. She is the same class as [[Eric Cartman]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Token Black]], moving slowly but dealing heavy damage. Her unique special ability has her yell out \"Sunshine!\" and causes damage to all enemies within a small radius. She also has a fast charge rate.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nRed plays a minor role in this game; the player helps her, Wendy, and Bebe find out who amongst them is a \"two-faced bitch\" in order to recruit the girls for the final battle. The player then goes on to the next mission to pose as Bebe's boyfriend, before posing as a girl to enter the abortion clinic. After successfully completing the quest and recruiting the girls, Red adds the player as a Facebook friend, dubs him an \"honorary girl\", and asks him if he wants to do some shopping.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nThroughout days 1 and 2, including the mission [[Operation: Just 'Cause]], Red can be seen playing cards with Nichole and a selfie can be taken with her. After Day 2, she becomes unavailable as she is nowhere to be found in South Park.\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery mode=packed captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nRedscicard.png|'''[[Alien Queen Red]]'''\nRedMysCard.png|'''[[Dark Angel Red]]'''\nRedFanCard.png|'''[[Dragonslayer Red]]'''\nRedAdvCard.png|'''[[Swashbuckler Red]]'''\nRedSupCard.png|'''[[Changeling Red]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - She is seen on the bus and later in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s classroom.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - She is seen on the bus with [[Bebe Stevens]].\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" - She is seen performing in a school play as an Indian.\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - Seen in the classroom.\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Seen in the classroom.\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Seen laughing with the others about [[Terrance and Phillip]].\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - Seen in a Chewbacca costume.\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - She is seen frightened as a flock of wild turkeys invade and destroy the [[The 4th Grade|classroom]].\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - She is seen singing \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".
