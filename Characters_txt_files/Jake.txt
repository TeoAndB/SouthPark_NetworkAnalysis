His appearance was short-lived, however, as he got too close to a carnivorous flower and was presumably eaten. Despite [[Ms. Stevens]] presumably failing to save him, he was seen later in the episode, so it should be assumed that he is alive.\n\nJake had a cameo in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (most notably at the \"[[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]]\" meeting, which he left due to there being no \"punch and pie\"), at the dance in \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\", and as a prisoner at [[Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall]] in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nJake has short, grayish-brown hair, had freckles, and wears a green sweater and brown pants. In ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'', he wears a yellow sweater.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Jake\">\nSPW_pic_--_Jake1.jpg|Jake singing in \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\".\nGGWKChoirBoyJake.jpg|Jake in \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\".\nSPW_pic_--_Jake3.jpg|Jake and the other kids, right before the giant plant grabbed him in its mouth.\nJake_7 season.png|Jake sitting\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nJake knows everything about the rainforest and is the leader of the Getting Gay with Kids choir. He may have also died because he was being eaten by a carnivorous flower and Ms. Stevens was trying to get Jake out; it is possible that Ms. Stevens succeeded, or didn't succeed and there was an error in his continuation on the show, since he did appear in a couple of episodes like \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\" (in this example he was a prisoner), made a cameo in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (he was the one who wanted to know if there was punch and pie or not and after that he left the meeting), and was seen at the dance in \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\". In the episode \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\", he's probably the only kid other than [[Kelly]] who talked the whole episode until he possibly died from being eaten by the carnivorous flower.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\" - Leader of the Getting Gay with Kids choir.\n*\"[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\" - Asks for punch and pie.\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" - Seen at the school dance.\n*\"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\" - Seen in prison.\n*\"[[Casa Bonita]]\" - Seen in the montage where Cartman ripped on Kyle for being Jewish.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:杰克]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Getting Gay with Kids]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]"
