[[Stan Marsh]], who was dating [[Wendy Testaburger]] at the time, even began vomiting whenever he saw her, a trait he'd only previously displayed for Wendy. Wendy became jealous, trying to get Stan to notice her, while the boys bought her presents, and mentioned her to Chef. After failing to win her over, Chef reveals that she is a lesbian. The boys then proceed to munch boxes and lick carpets in a misguided attempt to become lesbians.\n\nWendy eventually breaks down in front of the class, giving up and wishing Ms. Ellen and Stan a happy life together. At this moment, Iraqi soldiers burst into the room, revealing that she's allegedly a murderous spy who has been having an affair with [[Saddam Hussein]] and make an attempt to take her into custody. Ms. Ellen takes a sword in a bid to escape, accidentally tossing it at [[Kenny McCormick]], and is ultimately taken away.\n\nIt is revealed at the episode's conclusion, that Wendy had orchestrated the events, including the Iraqis taking her away, and her being blasted into the sun, thus to her demise.\n\n==Appearance==\nMs. Ellen has short parted black hair, red lips, and thin eyebrows. She wears a long dark-grey skirt, a gray collared shirt, and a dark blue, long-sleeved sweater. On the day that Mr. Garrison returns from surgery, she wears black leather: including tight black pants, a black top that reveals her belly, and a large cross necklace.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Ms. Ellen\">\nMsEllen1.png|Ms. Ellen being introduced to the class for the first time in \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\".\nTomsRhinoplasty037.png|Ms. Ellen sitting at her desk.\nMsEllen2.png|Chef singing to Ms. Ellen.\nTomsRhinoplasty040.png|Ms. Ellen being threatened by Wendy.\nTomsRhinoplasty041.png|Ms. Ellen receives a gift.\nTomsRhinoplasty063.png|Ms. Ellen and Mr. Garrison.\nTomsRhinoplasty072.png|Ms. Ellen has dinner with Stan.\nTomsRhinoplasty082.png|Ms. Ellen being revealed as Maqesh Alaq Makaraqesh.\nMsEllen4.png|Ms. Ellen being shot into the center of the sun by Arabs.\nMExican.png|Stan's drawing of Mrs. Ellen.

The first replacement to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] to die as well.\n*Her voice actress, [[Natasha Henstridge]], was the first female celebrity to have worked on the show.\n*She makes a very brief appearance at the end of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', despite her passing.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[es:Srta.
