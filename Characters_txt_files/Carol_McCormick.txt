She yells at Kenny for wanting to miss church in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' to go watch ''[[Asses of Fire]]'' while Stuart stood up for the Church in \"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\", where they were one of the few families in town that didn't convert to atheism. They also continue to pray after Kenny has died on a few occasions, and Kenny's funerals, when they occur, are always religious in nature.\n\nIn \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\", it is revealed that she joined [[Cult of Cthulhu|The Cult of Cthulhu]] for free beer and regrets it because she has to rebirth Kenny every time he dies.\n\n===Interests===\nShe seems to like knitting. In \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", she is shown knitting when Kenny tells her that he made her favorite drink. She also says that knitting a sweater is better than molesting children in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\".\n\n===Voice Acting===\nFrom 1997 to 1999, she was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. Bergman described the character as one of her five favorite voice roles in the series, together with [[Liane Cartman]], [[Sheila Broflovski]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Shelly Marsh]], also mentioning that she based the voice of the character on a \"female version of Bill Clinton\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wackyvoices.com/south.html |title=The Babes of South Park |accessdate=April 25, 2009}}</ref> After Bergman's death, the character was voiced by [[Eliza Schneider]], from 1999 to 2003. Since 2004, her voice has been provided by [[April Stewart]].\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:45a.jpg|thumb|left|Carol on the SP-site]]\nCarol wears a lime-green T-shirt which usually reads \"I'm with Stupid\", and dark blue jeans. The arrow is supposed to point at Stuart, but she is usually standing on the wrong side of him, so it points off in some other direction. Her hair is red, and similar in style to [[Red]]'s, but her bangs go in the same direction as [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s. She has a shadowy patch on her right cheek, which may be a bruise, or simply filth.[[File:Screenshot-by-nimbus_(6).png|thumb|Carol in her formal attire in \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\"]]\n\nIn \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", her shirt had an American flag embroidered on it, accompanied by the phrase \"God Bless\". When the McCormick's went on the John Denver experience, however, it appeared as a solid green T-shirt. In \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\", it is a solid, but darker green.\n\nFor special occasions, she wears a fake fur coat with a red crop top underneath and a red miniskirt, but as of [[Season Twelve]] she would wear a dark green blouse and a long gray skirt. At events such as fenerals, she wears a much more black fancy shirt and dress with a veil. \n\nAt night, she wears a nightshirt with several bunnies on it and pajama pants.\n\nAs of \"[[The Ring]]\", like many other adults, her appearance has been cleaned up, including small subtle changes to her hairstyle, T-shirt, arms and pants. Her arms have been straightened, the shirt is no longer angled, and her hair now has fine detail.\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Carol McCormick}}\n\n==Personality==\n[[Image:210_parents_with_herpes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Her original appearance]] She and her husband [[Stuart McCormick]] are prone to excessive drinking, and often fight and bicker with one another. Carol often claims that if Stuart would stop drinking and being lazy, and get a job, they might not be so hungry and poor. Their fighting often escalates to physical beating, and she [[Chickenlover|once gave him a black eye.]] She seems to have quite soome strength, seeing as when she hits Stuart as well as when she tackled Gerald Broflovski to the ground in \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\". Carol does care for Stuart deep down, though, as she was concerned for him when he went ill after consuming a drink mixed with abortion medication, got his nose broken on the John Denver experience, and was molested by the entire [[NAMBLA]] Society in \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\". \n\nHowever, she also seems to think that the McCormick residence primarily belongs to her, as in \"[[Chickenlover]]\", she says (regarding Stuart): \"I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!\" and yells a similar phrase at him in \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\". However, Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] built that same house when they were teenagers, as revealed in \"[[Chickenpox]]\".\n\nShe speaks with a thick Southern accent.\n\n==Family==\n===Stuart McCormick===\n{{Main|Stuart McCormick}}\n[[File:Screen Shot 2016-01-19 at 9.19.25 PM.png|thumb|220x220px]]\nStuart and his wife have been together for at least ten years. She appears familiar with his high school history in \"[[Chickenpox]]\" suggesting that they may have been together as far back as then and before the birth of their eldest child. They share a love of drinking and drugs and have been seen fighting over such substances before. They are often depicted arguing and even physically fighting with one another, but the series seems to reinforce that they do care about each other, particularly in \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\". Kenny sees this behavior between them as normal, dismissing it in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', during which they can be heard having sex after one of their fights.\n\n===Kevin McCormick===\n{{Main|Kevin McCormick}}\nVery little is known about Kevin or any of his relationships. She seems to care for him, scolding Kenny for not sharing a blanket with Kevin in \"[[Spookyfish]]\". When Stuart and Kevin got into a drunken fight, Carol insulted both her husband and son but she also tried to stop Stuart from fighting Kevin in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\".\n\n===Kenny McCormick===\n{{Main|Kenny McCormick}}\nKenny is her second child and younger son, and they have a good relationship, often driven by her desire for him to make something more of himself and avoid making mistakes. She was confrontational when warning him to attend church in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", she was willing to buy a hundred dollars' worth of [[Ritalin]] for Kenny's supposed ADD problem. She tried to make extra allowances for him during her pregnancy in \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\" so he would not feel left out or ignored. In \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\" when she notices how Kenny had done nothing but play his new PSP, she expresses openly that she doesn't want Kenny's future to be like her and Stuart's life and though confrontational is clearly concerned for him.\n\nShe is afraid of his alter-ego Mysterion in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\", whom he uses to scare his parents into submission and manipulate them to treat the kids better. When her children are taken away in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\", she does not want to see them go and is distressed being separated from them.\n\nAt the end of \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", after Kenny dies, she gives birth to a baby who looks just like Kenny. She mentions this being the fifty-second occurrence of this happening, correlating with his number of deaths on the show at that time. This indicates that every time Kenny dies, he is reborn and grows to be his age within a day's time or less. This is later reaffirmed in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\" when Kenny kills himself at the end, and she remarks with some regret that she and her husband should haver never attended a \"[[Cult of Cthulhu|stupid cult meeting]]\", confirming she is aware of Kenny's deaths.\n\nThough she and her husband are aware of his numerous deaths, they care deeply for their son and always seem genuinely horrified by his illnesses deaths, attending his stays in the hospital and arranging funerals. In \"[[Spookyfish]]\" she shows up at the [[Marsh Residence]] extremely drunk in one such instance, blaming Kenny's death for her state. In \"[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]\", she and her husband were shocked and extremely disturbed when Kenny's remains were delivered to them by Mr. Hankey, which further reinforces her love for him.\n\n===Karen McCormick===\n{{Main|Karen McCormick}}\nKaren is her daughter, a rather shy and timid child who often relys on Kenny for support and protection, though her relationship with her mother seems good.In \"[[The Poor Kid]]\", Carol holds Karen in her arms while trying to stop a fight between Stuart and Kevin, and Karen asks for her mother when she and her siblings are in [[The Soft Room]]. In \"[[The City Part of Town]]\", she holds Karen on her lap during the gentrification meeting and has her arm around her when they're sitting on their couch. She does care greatly for Karen's well-being, as shown in \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\" when she is concerned about Karen bringing in a syringe from the homeless living outside their house.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Carol McCormick's first name was unknown until ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where Stuart finally reveals that her name is Carol when the two were arguing. Her name itself may be both a reference to how both [[Liane Cartman|Liane Cartman's]] and [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski's]] first names were originally Carol, and how the majority of the fandom would refer to Carol by the name of Carol.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - She and [[Stuart McCormick|Stuart]] cheer [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] on while he is fishing for a can of preserved food.
