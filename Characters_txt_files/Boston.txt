The band made a brief appearance in the [[Season Twenty]] episode \"[[Skank Hunt]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Gerald Broflovski]] decides to take a night trolling message boards online as [[Skankhunt42]], he puts in a record that plays the Boston song [[Smokin']]. A montage is then shown of Gerald trolling, with him ending up on stage with the members of Boston at one point.\n\nSmokin also plays during a portion of Season Twenty's finale \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\", when [[Kyle Broflovski]] tries to overload the TrollTrace servers using his dad's Skankhunt42 account.\n\n==Appearance==\nAll of the band members have mustaches, aside from guitarist Tom Scholz. They appear to have old 70s hairstyles.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Boston\">\nSkankHunt00014.png|Gerald onstage while Boston performs\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen onstage with Gerald during his trolling montage.\n*\"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\" - Don't appear physically, but their song Smokin plays again.\n\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n[[fr:Boston]]\n[[zh:波士顿乐队]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
