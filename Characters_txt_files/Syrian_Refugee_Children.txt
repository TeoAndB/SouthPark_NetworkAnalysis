"{{South Park character\n|name = Syrian Refugee Children\n|image = S19E01_Syrian_Refugee_Children.jpg\n|race = Middle Eastern\n|hair = Various; Black and Brown\n|appearance = \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Syrian Refugee Children''' appear in [[Season Nineteen]] episode \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\", as part of Cartman's plan to get rid of [[PC Principal]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Syrian refugee children were one of the stages in [[Eric Cartman]]'s plan to get rid of the [[PC Delta]] in \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\". \n\nThe plan consists of several stages of increasingly offensive, outrageous stereotypes and behavior to create chaos and violence among the PC bros, ultimately leading to the deaths of all the PC bros. \n\nThe plan starts by using [[200 Pregnant Mexican Women]] to eat the tacos launched by the taco launchers, who then fall asleep and give birth to anchor babies. The PC bros would then be further distracted by a flood of Syrian refugee children, who would then be chased by [[Jared Fogle]], who is intent on molesting them.\n\n==Appearance==\nAll of the children vary in appearance but are all Middle Eastern in descent. Some of the female children wear dresses and headscarves, while some of the male children wear shirts, T-shirts, and occasionally a hat.\n\nOne of the children looks similar to [[David Rodriguez]].\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n[[ja:シリア難民の子供]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
