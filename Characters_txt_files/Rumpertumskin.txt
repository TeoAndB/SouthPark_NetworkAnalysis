It made its first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\".\n\n==Background==\nDuring the events of \"[[1%]]\", Rumpertumskin was inadvertently destroyed by Eric Cartman after he tripped a trip-wire trap which detonated a bomb collar around Rumpertumskin's neck. Although the perpetrator of the \"killing\" was thought to have been Polly Prissypants, it was actually Eric Cartman who was pressured by his peers and by his mother indirectly to grow up and give up his stuffed animals.\n\nRumpertumskin appeared in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nRumpertumskin is an overweight purple dragon with a pink stomach, pink wings, and burgundy spikes on its head and tail.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Rumpertumskin\">\nRumpertumpskin.jpg|Rumpertumskin on South Park Studios.\n1313 15.jpg|Rumpertumskin in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\".\nS15E1200013.png|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] cries to his stuffed toys including Rumpertumskin in \"[[1%]]\".\nS15E1200014.png\nS15E1200076.png|Rumpertumskin in chains just before it is blown up in \"[[1%]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" - Cartman has a tea party with his stuffed toys.\n*\"[[Cat Orgy]]\" - Rumpertumskin kidnaps \"Salma Hayek\" (Polly Prissypants) and holds her hostage in Cartman's acting out of the movie ''Wild Wild West''.\n*\"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" - It appears in the background of Cartman's morning announcement videos.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Cartman finds comfort in his stuffed toys and they are eventually “murdered”.\n\n__NOWYSIWYG__\n[[zh:汤普金斯龙]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]"
