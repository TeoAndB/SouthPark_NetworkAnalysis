He was seen tied to a chair right before the Jerseyites started advancing upon [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. [[Randy Marsh]] interrogated him. When he replied, \"It's a Jersey thing\", Randy starts beating him up, asking what he means. \n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears a white shirt, a tan vest emblazoned with a decorative \"S\" near the right shoulder, a belt with a buckle bearing the letters \"TS\", and blue jeans. \n\n==Personality==\nHe seems to be unintelligent, to the point of not being able to explain what ''\"It's a Jersey thing\"'' means, although several other Jerseyites were the same way, so it is likely that he is of average intelligence among the other Jerseyites.\n\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Better image needed]]"
