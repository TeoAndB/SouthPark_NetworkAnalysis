He appears in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, \"[[W.T.F.]]\".\n\n==Background==\nMr. Conners was fired due to the lack of interest among the students in real wrestling. [[Principal Victoria]] confuses the sport with W.W.E. type events and cites the dramatic adult story-lines in the newspaper as well as mistaking wrestling videos on his iPhone with \"gay\" pornography.\n\nHe was also a highly accomplished Olympic wrestler as his living room was filled with awards and trophies.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears a gray wrestling singlet. He also wears large, gray and white sneakers, long gray socks, a gray kneecap on his right knee, and white protective headgear.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mr. Conners\">\nWTF010.png|Mr. Conners teaching wrestling to a few [[List of Male 4th Graders|male fourth graders]].\nWTF012.png|Mr. Adams putting [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in a wrestling position.\nWTF043.png|''\"This is not wrestling!!!\"''\nWTF059.png|Mr. Conners after being fired.\nWTF071.png|Mr. Conners wrestling a security guard.\nWTF077.png|Mr. Conners about to fire a rocket at the WWE president.\nWTF079.png|''\"This is wrestling!\"''\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nMr. Conners appeared to be very devoted to wrestling, even going as far as to try and kill the W.W.E. President [[Vince McMahon]], in order to show people what real wrestling is. After giving a heartfelt speech to the [[Wrestling Takedown Federation]] audience, Vince McMahon offers him a job and proclaims \"Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen\". Mr. Conners accepts the offer, backsliding on his former hatred of the W.W.E., now that he is recognized for his real wrestling talents.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Thirteen}}\n[[zh:康纳斯教练]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Former school faculty]]"
