This helped the video become one of the first \"viral videos\" on the internet back in 1995.\n\n==Appearance==\nWhen two years later ''South Park'' debuted on [[Comedy Central]] the creators cast him as a \"gay dog\" named [[Sparky]] that runs away from home and joins [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]].\n\nA year later Mr. Clooney received a speaking role in the feature film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' as [[Dr. Doctor]].\n\nOnly a recording was used in \"[[Smug Alert!]]\", taken from George's acceptance speech at the 78th Academy Awards which was put into a dark \"Smug Cloud\" that took over the West Coast.\n\n==Quotes==\n*'''Stan:''' \"Don't be gay, Sparky.\"<br />'''Sparky:''' \"Woof?\"\n*'''Doctor Gouache:''' \"We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about three seconds to live.\" - While operating on Kenny.\n*'''Doctor Gouache:''' \"It never gets any easier!\" - Walking away from the operating table while whistling.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\"\n*\"[[Smug Alert!]]\"\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - A real life photo of George Clooney is seen on [[Bob White]]'s [[QAnon]] board as well as a South Park-style version of him when the [[Female QAnon Tutor]] explains the Hollywood elites to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Trey Parker]] said that the story for Stan's dog running away came from personal experience when he was young.\n*George was rumored one of the friends to be given with ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'' video tape.\n*When Keenan Williams says, \" If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.\" This is a reference to the movie George starred in named ''The Perfect Storm'', which also explains why George was a storm cloud.\n*George Clooney's role as a bad doctor is a reference to his popular role as Dr. Doug Ross on the TV series ''ER'' from 1994 to 2000 and once in 2009.\n*The Smug Cloud is a pun of Smog Cloud which is caused by carbon dioxide pollution in the upper atmosphere.\n*George Clooney has stated that he was not offended by his portrayal in \"[[Smug Alert!]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n[[es:George Clooney]]\n[[ja:ジョージ・クルーニー]]\n[[zh:乔治·克鲁尼]]\n[[Category:Agnostics]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:Celebrity voice actors]]\n[[Category:Mentioned-only characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]"
