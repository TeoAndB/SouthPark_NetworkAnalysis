She appeared in \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\". She was the only wife of Jack, while Jack did impregnate [[Liane Cartman]], they were not married.\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Eric Cartman]] bought the pubic hair of Scott Tenorman in \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\", thinking that it was the means in which to reach maturity, he made several fruitless attempts to get revenge on Scott. One of his first attempts involved getting a pony to bite off Scott's penis, which unfortunately proved less than effective as the pony preferred to suck on the wiener, rather than bite it. This was witnessed by [[Jimbo Kern]] and [[Ned Gerblansky]], who decided to help Cartman make a better plan through recon. While Cartman gathered his intel, Ned and Jimbo were distracted by the fact that Mrs. Tenorman, who was well known for her large breasts, was getting undressed near an open window. Jimbo and Ned were caught by Mrs. Tenorman's husband, Jack, along with [[Randy Marsh]], [[Stuart McCormick]], [[Gerald Broflovski]] and two more unidentified men all of who were spying on her.\n\nLater, in his next plot at vengeance, Cartman created an elaborate scheme in which he uses Scott to convince his parents to 'save' a pony from being slaughtered at [[Farmer Carl Denkins]] ranch. When Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman attempted to save the pony, they are then shot to death by Farmer Denkins. Meanwhile, as Denkins filed a report to [[Officer Barbrady]], Cartman stole their bodies and then proceeded to grind them up and feed them to Scott as chili.\n\nLater in the episode \"[[201]]\", it was revealed that 9 years prior to the events of \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\", Jack Tenorman had played Right Tackle for the [[Denver Broncos]]. On the night of the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], he, along with the entire Bronco team, and a majority of the men and women in South Park proceeded to have sexual relations with [[Liane Cartman]]. However, Jack managed to impregnate her, resulting in the birth of Eric Cartman. The town, not wanting anything to distract from the Bronco's winning season, opted to keep the truth of Eric's father a secret, until years later when Scott discovered the truth.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe wears a light blue skirt, a lavender v-neck shirt, gray leggings, and black shoes. Her makeup consists of red lipstick. She has short brown hair.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is much unknown if Mrs. Tenorman knew of her husband's affair with Ms. Cartman, or if the town hid the truth from her as well as Eric and Scott, before her death.\n*Both Mrs. Tenorman and [[Sharon Marsh]] are known for having the most attractive breasts in South Park.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cartman Family}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[es:Sra.
