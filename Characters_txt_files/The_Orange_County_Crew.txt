They are a very arrogant and obnoxious group of children who intimidate and laugh at [[the boys]] for not being able to dance as well as them, for no apparent reason at all, whether the boys are dancing or not. \n\n==Background==\nThe OC dance crew challenged the boys to dance in the [[True-Value Hardware]] parking lot. Not knowing what was happening, the boys were \"served\" by OC Crew. In their confusion, they went to [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]]'s house to tell him about the confrontation. Chef then called the boys' parents, treating the entire situation like a dramatic event. Back at Stan's home, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] taught Stan how to defend himself, next time, with line dancing to country music. When Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman met the OC Crew again, Stan \"served\" them back by dancing to the song \"[[Achy Breaky Heart]]\" by Billy Ray Cyrus. The OC Crew then demanded that they challenge them at the OC Convention Center for a chance to be in a music video with [[Lil' Kim]].\n\nStan found a group of talented dancers for the dance-off, consisting of Michael from the [[Goth Kids]], a boy from an arcade named [[Yao]], a [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] waitress named [[Mercedes]], a dancing duck named [[Jeffy]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. Butters is a tap dancer, who retired due to a tragic tap-dancing accident at a talent competition, in which audience members were killed from his shoe flying off knocking down several spotlights on them.\n[[File:YGFTA67.png|thumb|left]]\nWith no chance of winning the OC dance competition, Stan and [[The South Park Diggities]] did their best against the OC Crew. When Butters began his tap-dancing routine, tragedy struck, again, when his shoe flew off, knocking the stage lights down onto the Orange County Crew, killing them all. Everyone cheered for Butters, but he was upset because of the tragedy happening a second time.\n\n==Appearance==\nAll of the OC Crew children are minorities.\n\nLil' Sheep appears to be older than the other children, as he is physically taller than them. He wears gray sweatpants, a black T-shirt, and a gray cap with his name embroidered in white. In the original airing of the episode his cap had \"Lil Shiit\" instead of \"Lil Sheep\".\n\nGirl T wears pink jogging pants, a white undershirt, a pink coat, glasses, and a teal belt. She also wears a pink hair tie. She also wears a necklace and large, silver hoop earrings.\n\nThe unnamed Asian male wears brown cargo pants, a blue tank top, blue sweatbands, and a black and gray cap, similar to Stan's, but without the puffball. He also wears a silver chain with a medallion.\n\nThe unnamed African American male wears blue pants, a long-sleeved red shirt, a red sweatband, and a silver crucifix necklace.\n\nThe unnamed Latino male wears a green tracksuit, consisting of green pants, a green jacket, a red undershirt, and a green bandana.\n\nThe coach wears gold and purple pants and a gold and purple shirt, he has an earring on his right ear and has a mustache.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[The South Park Diggities]]\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eight}}\n[[zh:奥兰治县舞队]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
