He appeared in purgatory in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, \"[[Dead Celebrities]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe was first heard talking to a nurse, telling her and the boys that [[Michael Jackson]] wouldn't admit to his death and that was keeping everyone stranded in purgatory. Like everyone else on the plane, he thought sitting on a plane doing nothing was bad enough without [[Billy Mays]] selling his products. But when the plane went to [[Hell]], he reacted badly, like the other passengers. He now resides in Hell.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe appeared as an old man, with thick gray eyebrows and a gray mustache. He wears a black suit with a green, black striped tie.\n\n==Personality==\nHe appears to be irritated by [[Michael Jackson]]'s refusal to accept that he is dead, although this is not abnormal, as the rest of the celebrities were irritated as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[zh:沃尔特·克伦凯特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
