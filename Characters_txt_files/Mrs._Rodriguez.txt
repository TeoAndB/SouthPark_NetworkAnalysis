She first appears in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, \"[[You're Not Yelping]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[You're Not Yelping]]\", Mrs. Rodriguez is hard at work in her family's restaurant preparing meals for [[Eric Cartman]], who is posing as a yelp critic in order to receive free food. Her husband, in a panic, asks her to rush two taco orders for Cartman.\n\nAfter [[Whistlin' Willy's]] stands up to [[Gerald Broflovski]]'s antics as a yelp critic, she and her husband become excited that they can finally stop giving these people excessive amounts of service. Unfortunately, this was short-lived as the yelp critics fought back against Whistlin' Willy's. She and her husband had decided to shut down the restaurant. The restaurant was later saved with David's [[The Yelper Special|plan]] to subtly retaliate against the yelpers.\n\n==Appearance==\nMrs. Rodriguez wears black shoes, blue pants, and a red shirt. She wears two bracelets, gold and green respectively, and teal hoop earrings. She has long, black hair.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mrs. Rodriguez\">\nDavidsParents1.png|Davids parents frantically trying to keep Cartman happy.\nDavidsParents2.png|Davids parents happy they can ignore yelp critics.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[You're Not Yelping]]\" - Seen working at her family restaurant, [[Nueva Familia]].\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - Seen with her family at the new [[Whole Foods Market]].\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" - Seen at [[Jimbo's Guns]]； later seen in the crowd of people standing in front of Whole Foods Market.\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Shots|Shots!!!]]\" - Seen at the CDC Child Immunization challenge.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n[[zh:罗德里格斯太太]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
