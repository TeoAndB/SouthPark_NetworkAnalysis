Having believed them, the children race to take Jambu to [[Clyde Donovan]]'s house, where he has a pool, and then to Mexico where the whale was to be sent to the moon in a rocket. Jambu died after being sent into space and its body now lies on the moon.\n\nJambu made a brief cameo, still dead, when [[Tom Cruise]] was sent to the moon in a similar fashion. Both lie next to each other on the moon.\n\n==Appearance==\nJambu looks like a typical killer whale. It is mostly black with a white underside and red inside its mouth.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Jambu\">\nFreeWillzyx (13).png|[[Kyle Broflovski]] speaking to Jambu at the Denver Sea Park in \"[[Free Willzyx]]\".\nFreeWillzyx (81).png|Kyle keeping Jambu wet in the truck on their way to Mexico.\nFreeWillzyx (111).png|Jambu being loaded into the ocean and then into a whale net to be launched to the moon.\njambu 4.png\njambu 3.png\nmoon jambu tom.png|Jambu with [[Tom Cruise]] on the moon in \"[[201]]\".\nmoon jambu tom 2.png|Jambu with [[Tom Cruise]] on the moon in \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jambu's character and likeness is based on [[wikipedia:Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]], a trick performing whale at [[wikipedia:SeaWorld|Sea World]], as well as [[wikipedia:Keiko (killer whale)|Keiko]], the male orca that starred in the 1993 film ''[[wikipedia:Free Willy|Free Willy]]'', which the episode where Jambu appears, \"[[Free Willzyx]]\", is based upon.\n**Furthermore, Keiko lived a significant portion of his life in an amusement park in Mexico City, which could have been the inspiration for the prominent appearance of the country of Mexico and its inhabitants during the episode.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Free Willzyx]]\" - The boys and other members of their class help Jambu get to the moon, where they think that his family fully unaware that the whole thing is just a prank.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Seen dead beside [[Tom Cruise]].\n*\"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\" - Again, seen dead beside Tom Cruise.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nine}}\n[[ja:ジャンブー]]\n[[zh:鲸布]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]"
