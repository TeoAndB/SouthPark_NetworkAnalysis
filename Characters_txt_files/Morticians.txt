They appear in the [[Season One]] episode \"[[Pinkeye]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is taken to the South Park Morgue after being crushed by a [[MIR Space Station]]. While the morticians are embalming Kenny, one of them starts eating a hotdog with [[Limey Charles Worcestershire Sauce]]. The Worcestershire sauce would later spill into the embalming fluid tank by accident, causing Kenny to be revived as a zombie, who would in turn bite both of the morticians.\n\nThe morticians then visit the [[South Park Clinic]] for medical consultation, where the doctor diagnoses them with [[Pinkeye (Virus)|pinkeye]] (despite showing all the symptoms of a zombie). Both the morticians later turn into zombies themselves, with one of them eventually making his way to the doctor and biting him along with a few other zombies.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe morticians wear lab coats over a black shirt and black pants.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:殡仪员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]"
