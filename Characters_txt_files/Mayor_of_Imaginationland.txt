Given his title, he is the Mayor of [[Imaginationland]].\n\n==Background==\nHe sang the song of the attraction, called the [[Imagination Song]], when he delivers [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]], and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to [[Imaginationland]] in his blimp. Butters fears he wants to rape them due to his overly happy personality and looks, something that the Mayor cautiously denies.\n\n[[File:ImaginationlandPartIII23.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Mayor after being re-imagined.]]\nHe dies in the terrorist attack on Imaginationland when the [[The Alien (Xenomorph)|Xenomorph]] from the Alien film series tears out his organs.\n\nIn the end of \"[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]\", Butters revives the Mayor by re-imagining him, and consequentially, he also re-imagines Imaginationland after it was destroyed.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Mayor of Imaginationland wears yellow pants with red polkadots, a white collared shirt under a purple velvet vest, a red trenchcoat, and a red bow tie. He is overweight and has brown hair, rosy red cheeks, and a brown mustache. He also wears white gloves and a large purple top hat. He has a gold pocket watch with a gold chain held within his left vest pocket.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Mayor of Imaginationland\">\nImaginationland21.jpg|The Mayor at the end of \"[[Imaginationland]]\".\nImaginationlandPartII06.jpg|The Mayor dying in the beginning of \"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Imaginationland]]\" -\n*\"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\" - Gets killed by a Xenomorph\n*\"[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]\" - Gets revived by Butters.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n[[ja:空想世界の長]]\n[[zh:幻想大陆市长]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Imaginationland characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Made-up characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
