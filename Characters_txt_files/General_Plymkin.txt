He has made two appearances, one in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and another in \"[[Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]\".\n\n==Background==\nGeneral Plymkin is very racist and uses black soldiers as human shields and to protect the tanks and planes by strapping them to the sides of the vehicles. The way in which he briefed the troops parodied that of the briefing scene in ''Return of the Jedi''.\nThis plan fails when [[Chef]] rallies the black troops out of harms way when the Canadians attack, leaving \"Operation Get Behind The Darkies\" all dead. \n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears a dark green suit, a white shirt, a black tie, and black shoes. On his coat are 3 embedded stars, signifying that he is a lieutenant general, and ranks. One of his most notable traits is the fact he always has a cigar in his mouth, a notable stereotype of soldiers. \n\n==Prominence==\n[[File:Human Shield.jpg|right|thumb|General Plymkin reminds ''Operation Human Shield'' to protect the tanks and planes too.]]\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Executed [[Bill Gates]] due to incompetency of Windows 98 and commands the US troops in the [[American-Canadian War]].\n*\"[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]\" - Shows him as the commander of the U.S. Troops deployed in Afghanistan to save the goat Stevie Nicks.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters Movie}}\n[[es:General Plymkin]]\n[[zh:皮林金将军]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:Military personalities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
