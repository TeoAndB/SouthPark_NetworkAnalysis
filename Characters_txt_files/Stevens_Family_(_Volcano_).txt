The family members reappeared occasionally as background characters in [[Season One]] and [[Season Two]].\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Volcano]]\" they appear in ''[[Lava and You]]'''s example of what to do when a volcano erupts near someone or a group of people, the family appears having a picnic. The daughter, Jane Stevens, notices a noise which is a nearby volcano erupting which worries Junior. The narrator says that Jane learned in school what to do when she hears a volcano erupt. Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family. They \"duck and cover\" while lava flows over the blanket causing no damage, thus starting the 2nd part of the video.\n\nThe mother and children reappear in \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" with a recurring background character replacing the father.\n\nIn \"[[Gnomes]]\", Junior reappeared with a different mother, here referred to here as '''Billy''', as he was approached by [[John Postum]] to buy a Kiddiecino.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe father has flat blue hair and wears a brown coat and blue jeans; the replacement father in \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" wears a gray coat with a light blue neckline, as well as messy short brown hair and brown jeans.\n\nThe mother has short brown hair and wears a orange dress, which is red in \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\".\n\nThe son has red short hair very reminiscent to his father and a red coat with a blue collar similar to [[Clyde Donovan]]. He also has blue jeans.\n\nThe daughter, Jane, has a short red ponytail as well as an orange coat, a brown skirt, and long socks.\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" caption=\"Images of the Stevens Family\">\nStevenfamilys1.png|The family decorating a tree in \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\".\nstevenfamily1.png|The family having a picnic in ''[[Lava and You]]''.\nstevenfamily2.png|Jane covers the family in a blanket.\nstevenfamily3.png|The family under a blanket with lava passing over them.\nGnomes17.jpg|[[John Postum]] offering Billy Coffee in \"[[Gnomes]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Volcano]]\" - They appear in \"[[Lava and You]]\".\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - They are seen decorating a Christmas tree during \"[[The Lonely Jew on Christmas]]\". However, the father is instead an already existing recurring background character from early seasons.\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\" - Junior and the mother are seen sitting on a blanket next to another mother with their child where the biggest snake was about to be lit.\n*\"[[Gnomes]]\" - Junior, here referred to as Billy, is seen on the street being offered Coffee by [[John Postum|Harbucks Camel Joe]]. His mother, a different background character here, tells him to leave Junior alone.\n\n==Trivia==\n*With the revelation that Junior is also known as Billy, with the nickname Junior suggesting he shares a name with his father, then his father's name is presumably William.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Stevens Family}}\n[[zh:史蒂文斯家族（火山爆发）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with changed names]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]"
