Timmy and Jimmy were accepted into the gang, on the one condition that they \"they pop some punk-ass [[Bloods (Gang)|Bloods]]\". After they inadvertently cause a traffic accident, killing thirteen of the Bloods standing in a parking lot, they are accepted and given new names. Jimmy's nickname becomes \"4-legs\" while Timmy's is \"Roller\". This action prompts the Bloods to retaliate by trying to kill Timmy and Jimmy in a drive-by shooting at their houses. To resolve this conflict, Jimmy rents the [[Denver Recreation Center]] and invites both gangs to an all-night lock-in, until they resolve their differences. Both gangs realize they have many things in common. Beginning a friendship, they play basketball and sing songs together, thus having a generally good time.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Crips wear blue handkerchiefs, blue clothes, and have many tattoos.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Crips are a real street gang based in Los Angeles, California, with members all around the world numbering in the tens of thousands.\n**They are rivals with the Bloods, as depicted in \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\".\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n[[fr:Crips (Gang)]]\n[[zh:瘸帮]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"
