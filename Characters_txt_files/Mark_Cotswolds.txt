Mark wants to go to a [[South Park Elementary|public school]] and begs his father for the chance.\n\nMark is made to go to school in a giant hamster ball and experiences bullying at the hands of the other boys and wound up duct-taped to a bench. Though his father wants him to return to homeschooling, Mark convinces his father to let him continue to go to public school, and attend the school dance.\n\nAt the [[Bay of Pigs Memorial Dance|dance]], Mark confronts [[Kyle Broflovski]] for turning [[Rebecca Cotswolds|Rebecca]] into a slut, and proceeds to beat him up. The other boys become impressed, now wanting to hang out with him and include him in their circles.\n\nThough his father tries to intervene and take Mark and Rebecca out of the dance, Mark convinces his father to let them go to public school, as the two of them would still have to face bad things someday, and it would be better to face them now.\n\nSince the episode, Mark has reappeared in the show, making cameos in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\", as a potential fourth friend, \"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\", in the group of kids sent to the camp (when they first appear), and at Cartman's party in \"[[Imaginationland]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nMark wears a deep green pullover sweater, with a white dress shirt and a black tie underneath, and black slacks. His hair is dark brown and slightly wavy, with a parting in the bangs.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mark Cotwolds\">\nHookedOnMonkeyFonics010.png|Mark performing in the spelling bee.\nHookedOnMonkeyFonics019.png|\"''We will have to do it again sometime.''\"\nHookedOnMonkeyFonics029.png|Mark in his hamsterball.\nHookedOnMonkeyFonics034.png|\"''Hey, kid.

Though he was continuously bullied by the others and found himself duct-taped to a bench, he was unconcerned and grew more curious each time.\n\nDespite his parents' objections, he remained eager to explore the outside world and ultimately gave a speech explaining why it was all right for him to stay in public school.\n\nHe seems quite protective of his sister, beating Kyle up after seeing what he had inadvertently turned her into, which the other boys then considered him to be \"badass\" for it.\n\nBy the end of his debut, he was finding his way into fitting in with the other boys, calling Stan a \"gaywad\" in response to being called \"nerdo\".\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" - Mark and Rebecca win the spelling bee. Mark is intrigued by other kids and wants to join the public school.\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - Mark is one of the contenders to replace Butters but doesn't make the cut past the first elimination round.\n*\"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\" - Mark is seen at the camp when the boys first arrive.\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" - Seen in [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] from the back.\n*\"[[Smug Alert!]]\" - Mark is seen at the party.\n*\"[[Imaginationland]]\" - Mark appears at Cartman's party.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:马克·科茨沃尔兹]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Nerds]]"
