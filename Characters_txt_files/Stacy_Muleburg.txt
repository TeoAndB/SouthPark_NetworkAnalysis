She has long brown hair with a pink bow to hold her ponytail. She has a snout-like nose and severely rotten teeth, which are likely the cause of her halitosis.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Stacy Muleburg]]\n[[zh:斯塔茜·穆勒博格]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
