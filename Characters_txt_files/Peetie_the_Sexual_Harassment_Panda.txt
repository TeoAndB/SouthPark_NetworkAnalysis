He is later fired after he indirectly convinces people to sue each other over petty things. His catchphrase is \"I’m a saaaaad panda.\"\n\nIt is revealed that he takes his job a little too seriously. He is sent to the \"[[Island of Misfit Mascots]]\" and later returns to the school as \"Peetie the Don't Sue People Panda\" after [[The Boys|the boys]] convince him to return to help save the school from bankruptcy, arguing that he has a good message but his current role isn't helping anybody.
