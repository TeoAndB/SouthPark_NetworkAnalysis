She appeared in the [[Season Ten]] episode \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\".\n\n==Background==\nMs. Stevenson served as the Kindergarten teacher for some time, during which one of her students, [[Ike Broflovski]], developed a crush on her, passing her love notes and drawing her with hearts around her. When this was brought to her attention by hallway monitor [[Eric Cartman]], she asked him to stay behind after class and tried to discuss why these feelings were inappropriate. She was instead revealed to be a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] when she became sidetracked and instead admitted she admired him and found him \"mysterious\" and acknowledged having feelings for him, leading them to start a romantic relationship, going on many dates together, as well as an intimate relationship involving sexual intercourse, which cannot be  consensual due to the fact Ike is 3-4 years old. She tried to keep her relationship secret from the rest of the town.\n\nMs. Stevenson's relationship with Ike was exposed by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who discovered them in the bath together, and she insisted that he was mature enough for a relationship despite his age. They were soon caught and turned in by Cartman when he caught the couple making out in the halls. She falsely claimed to be an alcoholic and attended rehabilitation for her drinking problem as a way to escape jailtime, during which she revealed to a counselor that her uncle would make her and her twin sister kiss and would take photographs.\n\nShe then kidnapped Ike and the two prepare to flee to Milan, claiming that she and Ike dreamed of buying a house in Tuscany. They were pursued by Cartman and Kyle, who brought along Cartman's hallway monitor crew, storming the hotel to stop the couple from fleeing the country, and tracking them to the roof of the airport Hilton. They were cornered by the boys and the police, who demanded that she surrender. Not wanting anyone interfering with their love life, Ms. Stevenson said she and Ike would jump off of the building so that she could be with Ike for eternity. However, Kyle convinced Ike that he was too young for a relationship at his age. Ms. Stevenson did not listen to reason and jumped, but Ike did not. Ms. Stevenson realized Ike had abandoned her shortly before she died on impact to the ground. \n\nShe was replaced by a [[Substitute Teacher|substitute]] as seen in \"[[Fatbeard]]\", before a new kindergarten teacher was first seen in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\". Neither character has been named.\n\nAn identical character appeared in \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\" as a shopper outside the [[South Park Mall]]. This could be considered her twin sister, although it is likely just an Easter egg.\n\n===Criminal Record===\n*'''Child Molestation:''' In \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\", she has a sexual relationship with [[Ike Broflovski]]. As he is underage, the relationship cannot be considered consensual by legal (or moral) standards.\n\n==Appearance==\nMs. Stevenson wore a dark gray sweater with a pink shirt underneath. She wore a blue knee-length skirt and black high heeled shoes. She had long blond hair in a ponytail, and was considered by most of the men in town to be attractive. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Ms. Stevenson\">\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy024.png|Stevenson teaching class.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy028.png|Stevenson talking with Ike\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy035.png|Their first date.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy036.png|Having a picnic together.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy037.png|Getting drawn as caricatures.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy038.png|Relaxing at home.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy039.png|After molesting Ike.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy040.png|Justifying herself afterward.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy054.png|Stevenson and Ike are busted in \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\".\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy057.png|Contemplating her defense.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy060.png|Ms. Stevenson explaining to Kyle that her love with Ike is true love.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy097.png|Cartman busts them to [[Principal Victoria]].\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy108.png|Ms. Stevenson calling from the Police Station.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy117.png|Holding a press conference about being an alcoholic.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy126.png|Stevenson kidnapping Ike from his home.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy143.png|Stevenson in a hotel room trying to entice Ike.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy160.png|Stevenson getting ready to jump off the roof of the building.\nMissTeacherBangsaBoy169.png|Falling to her death.\nMissStevensonsSister.jpg|Her character model reused in \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*She, [[Herbert Garrison]], [[Mr. Harris]] and [[Chef]] (after brainwashing) are all teachers at [[South Park Elementary]] who have exhibited inappropriate sexual behavior towards children.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n\n[[es:Sra.
