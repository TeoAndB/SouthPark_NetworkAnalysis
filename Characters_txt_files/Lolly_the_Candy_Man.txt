He appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\", and [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode, \"[[The Scoots]]\".\n\nLolly had a contest to see who would get to have a candy shopping spree in his store, which Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny won. He gave them a ticket stub, which Kenny held on to. In \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\", he would not allow Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to go on their candy shopping spree, unless they acquire their winning ticket stub within one week.\n\nIn \"[[The Scoots]]\", Mr. Mackey goes to Lolly's when he is desperate for candy for Halloween. Lolly is cleaned out, and so Mr. Mackey is refused at gunpoint.\n\n==Appearance==\nLolly is very overweight, he had red hair on the sides of his head and wide black eyebrows. He wore a clown costume consisting of a white t-shirt with pink stripes and lighter pink sleeves, cyan pants and black shoes.\n\nLater in \"[[The Scoots]]\" he appears to have lost weight and was wearing more normal clothes, which consisted of a long-sleeved brown shirt, dark blue pants and black shoes. He also seems to have aged since he had several warts on his face. His black eyebrows became gray and shorter and his red hair became brown and gray.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Lolly the Candyman\">\nLollycndy.png|Lolly's old look.\nMrharibo.png\nLolly-the-scoots.png|Lolly in \"[[The Scoots]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\"\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[The Scoots]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Lolly is most likely a spoof of [[wikipedia:Willy Wonka|Willy Wonka]], a man who owns a chocolate factory in the book ''[[wikipedia:Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.\n*Lolly is one of the few characters in South Park who got old.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Six}}\n[[zh:罗利]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]"
