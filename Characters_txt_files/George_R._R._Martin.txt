He was featured in the [[Season Seventeen]] episodes, \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\" and \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Eric Cartman|Wizard Eric]] sends [[Butters Stotch|Paladin Butters]] and [[Scott Malkinson]] to George Martin's house in a fact-finding mission on the outcome of the TV series ''Game of Thrones''. The mission was to enable Wizard Cartman the upper hand in getting Xbox Ones before anyone else on Black Friday. When Butters and Scott reach George's house, he annoys the two boys with his predilections rather than divulging anything that the boys need to complete their quest. After a literal \"song and dance\" the two boys have had enough and try to leave. Paladin Butters discloses his motivation to which George obliges by postponing Black Friday until December 6.\n\nIn \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\", George, who is supposed to cut the ribbon in front of the [[South Park Mall]] to officially start Black Friday, stalls by talking about wieners to the crowd. An [[Man with Brown Jacket|annoyed man]] cuts his penis off and then the ribbon, allowing the crowd into the mall.\n\n==Appearance==\nGeorge Raymond Richard Martin is stocky, has a grey beard, and a thick nose. He wears a black captains hat and glasses. He also wears a blue flannel shirt with suspenders and black shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nGeorge seems to be infatuated with penises, as he writes about them incessantly in ''Game of Thrones'', goes on and on about them in conversation, and even shows his own penis (off-camera) to Butters and Scott. He also has his house filled with things that resemble penises and conducts a choir in a song about penises.\n\nMartin is also shown to be a profligate liar, as he constantly promises things he has no intention of delivering, like pizzas and book sequels.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{WriterCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n[[es:George R.
