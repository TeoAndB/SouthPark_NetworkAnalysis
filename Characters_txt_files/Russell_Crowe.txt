The trailer is set to appear during a commercial break on Crowe's TV show, ''[[Russell Crowe Fightin' Around The World]]'' which depicts Crowe traveling the world, with his tugboat [[Tugger]], randomly beating people up. Crowe also appears in \"[[The Gauntlet]]\", a parody created for the MTV Movie Awards. He is in the role of Maximus Decimus Meridius but referred to as Russell Crowe. He also reappears in the episode \"[[200]]\" within the group of celebrities that the show has mocked in previous seasons. He picks up a fight with [[Buddha]] in the following episode \"[[201]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nRussell Crowe was shown with long combed brown hair, a brown beard, and some warts on his face. He was seen wearing a black shirt under a dark blue sailor uniform, gray pants, and black shoes. He also wears a white sailor cap with a black border.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Russell Crowe\">\nChefGoesNanners067.png|A portrait of Russell Crowe in \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\".\nTheNewTerranceandPhillipMovieTrailer164.png|Russell Crowe in \"[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]\".\nTheNewTerranceandPhillipMovieTrailer005.png|Russell Crowe in the [[The Gauntlet|Gladiator]] parody, \"The Gauntlet\".\nTheNewTerranceandPhillipMovieTrailer006.png|Russell Crowe punches a man.\nTheNewTerranceandPhillipMovieTrailer049.png|Russell Crowe punches a Chinese man.\nRussell Crowne-punch2.png|Russell Crowe punches a basketball player.\nRussellCroweSP.jpg|Russel Crowe winning an Oscar.\nEP201098.png|Russell Crowe fights Buddha\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe appears to be extremely insecure in his television show, beating people up without provocation. He also seems to take anything that is not praised as an insult.\n\n==Trivia==\n*On an episode of ''60 Minutes'', \"60 Minutes Crowe\", Crowe said the following in response to his appearance on ''South Park'': ''\"I think they are very, very funny men, and I wish them godspeed, and I hope they continue to do what they’re doing. For me, if there was something for me to learn from it, it is the analogous thing because I did think the whole thing was a fight, I did think my whole career was a struggle. I was born in Seatoun, New Zealand, in Wellington, and we're talking up here in a hotel in New York. That's a long way.\"''\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\" - Wendy hallucinates his faces on a poster as Cartman's.\n*\"[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]\"\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Six}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n[[es:Russell Crowe]]\n[[zh:罗素·克劳]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
