They later returned and expanded in \"[[Franchise Prequel]]\", only for the team to be torn apart by different franchise plans, a battle that was the primary focus of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\nThe final team lineup consisted of The Coon, [[Human Kite]], [[Mosquito]], [[Fastpass]], [[Super Craig]], and [[Captain Diabetes]] before they were absorbed by the [[Freedom Pals]].\n\n==Background==\nAmid an alleged crime wave, in town, the the Coon brought together eight heroes including himself at an elaborate headquarters constructed in [[Cartman Residence|his basement]] to form a team that could combat the rise in crime, offering them access to his resources, which are largely common household items, including basic equipment and electronics such as televisions and computers, with added Coon-branding. They had access to a \"Coon Mobile\", driven by [[Liane Cartman]] and more; however, members were asked to pay unspecified dues and fees for membership to enjoy these services. Only two members of the team were known to possess real superpowers, [[Mysterion]] and [[Mintberry Crunch]].\n\nTheir first mission was to help rescue people from a burning building, but the firemen, who were already there, keep them away from the scene for their safety. [[Captain Hindsight]] then arrives, tells the firemen what they did wrong, and leaves. The firemen consider the problem solved, and drive home, leaving 14 people to burn. The people's admiration for Hindsight enrages the Coon, who becomes obsessed with forcibly recruiting Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends, planning to dress [[Butters Stotch]] as Courtney Love and faking provocative photos of the two.\n\nThe group then attempts to help the victims of the DP oil spill, planning to sell lemon bars at a bake sale to raise money, however this gets set back when the Coon beats up Mosquito and Mintberry Crunch. The Coon is kicked out of the group by a unanimous vote for this and then grounded by his mom for beating up his friends and swearing soon thereafter.\n\nIn \"[[Mysterion Rises]]\", they proceed with the bake sale, gaining plenty of press attention and making some money for charity. Mysterion becomes the de facto leader, although it is presumed they take on a democratic vote, as suggested by Mosquito in \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\". They decide to keep the name 'Coon and Friends' specifically to spite the Coon, which Mysterion finds greatly amusing. The Coon, meanwhile, forms a new organization under the same name by teaming up with [[Cthulhu]], printing matching 'Coon and Friends' T-shirts for only the two of them.\n\nIn \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\", the Coon returns to town and implores Cthulhu to banish the members of Coon and Friends at Coon's command, to the [[City of R'Lyeh]], though Mintberry Crunch manages to run home before the banishment proceeds. Mysterion manages to escape by committing suicide and being reborn in the real world, while the others remain there waiting for help. They are ultimately rescued by Mintberry Crunch and brought back to the real world thanks to Mysterion.\n\nThe Coon and Friends reassemble in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, \"[[Franchise Prequel]]\", hoping to kick off a superhero franchise. Fastpass wins an audition to join the team after telling them his superhero origin story, while [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], with [[Mark Zuckerberg]]'s support, creates fake 'news' about the Coon and Friends group on Facebook ruining their reputation and keeping Netflix from greenlighting their superhero franchise. Super Craig is seen as a member of the group for the first time here, with [[Wonder Tweek]] appearing briefly at the end and [[Scott Malkinson]] is also mentioned to be a member.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg is trespassing into the town, Fastpass runs around him, providing a distraction for Tupperware, and fires bursts of energy at him, to which Zuckerberg fires back in his mind but misses every shot. The Human Kite then punches him in the crotch, sending him to the ground. He is subsequently attacked by all the remaining members of the Coon and Friends.\n\nZuckerberg stands up, and the Coon and Friends dramatically fall to the ground. The Coon announces to the citizens on site that Zuckerberg had attacked innocent children who were simply trying to save black lives, and simultaneously support Jews, and crippled people. Zuckerberg is thwarted by the Coon and Friends and is forced to take down [[Facebook]], ruining Professor Chaos's plan.\n\nDespite this, the group separates at the end of the episode due to petty franchise differences, introducing a major conflict that would be revisited in the [[South Park]] video game, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\n==Members==\nAs of the end of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the team is defunct and has merged into [[Freedom Pals]]. Below was the lineup of the team at the time of the merger.\n\n===[[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] ([[Eric Cartman]])===\n[[File:The Coon transparent.png|211px|thumb|The Coon]]\n{{main|The Coon (Character)}}\nWhen night falls in South Park, Eric Cartman takes up the call and dons the Coon costume. This fearless crime fighter is the only one who can sort through the trash can of society. As the founder of Coon and Friends, the Coon is the mastermind behind the greatest superhero franchise of all time and will stop at nothing to see it realised.\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Human Kite]] ([[Kyle Broflovski]])===\n[[File:Humankite.transparent.png|230px|thumb|Human Kite]]\n{{main|Human Kite}}\nFrom high above the battlefield the Human Kite, alias Kyle Broflovski, swoops into action striking fear into evil-doers everywhere. Blasting away his foes at range while supporting his fellow Coon Friends, the Human Kite is a powerful ally to have on your superhero team.\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Mosquito]] ([[Clyde Donovan]])===\n[[File:Mosquito.png|220px|thumb|Mosquito]]\n{{main|Mosquito}}\nBzz! Bzz! Bzz! That's that sound of justice when served by Mosquito. When Mosquito enters the fray, enemies are quickly drained of their will to fight...and blood. Behind closed doors, this insect-human hybrid superhero is better known as 4th grader Clyde Donovan.\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Fastpass]] ([[Jimmy Valmer]])===\n[[File:Fastpass.png|195px|thumb|Fastpass]]\n{{main|Fastpass}}\nLightning quick in battle and in wit, Jimmy Valmer adopts the persona of Fastpass to fight crime. Fastpass uses super speed to blindside his opponents. When he's not fighting side by side with the New Kid, Fastpass helps citizens travel quickly throughout [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with his Fast Travel stations.\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Super Craig]] ([[Craig Tucker]])===\n[[File:Superherores-super-craig.png|211px|thumb|Super Craig]]\n{{main|Super Craig}}\nCharging into battle, Super Craig uses super strength and a powerful sense of indifference to defeat evil. Accompanied by his guinea pig, [[Stripe]], he is a proud member of Coon and Friends. Hidden behind his Super Shirt, Super Craig is actually Craig Tucker, local 4th grader.\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[Captain Diabetes]] ([[Scott Malkinson]])===\n[[File:Captain Diabetes.png|201px|thumb|Captain Diabetes]]\n{{main|Captain Diabetes}}\nScott Malkinson could've been an ordinary child, but in a freak accident his mom farted on him during childbirth which gave him diabetes. Rather than dwelling on his misfortune, Captain Diabetes wields his sugary illness as a source of power that his enemies cannot overcome.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Original Lineup===\n[[File:Coon2PROMO.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Coon and Friends in their \"headquarters\".]]\nThe following characters were members of the team in the \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\" trilogy of episodes:\n*[[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] ([[Eric Cartman]]) - The ex-leader of Coon and Friends, kicked out in \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\" for being \"a dick.\"\n*[[Mysterion]] ([[Kenny McCormick]]) - De-facto leader of Coon and Friends after the Coon is kicked out. Being incapable of dying, he is one of two of the members to have actual superpowers.\n*[[Mint-Berry Crunch]] ([[Bradley Biggle]]) - Possesses \"the power of mint and berries, yet with a satisfying, tasty crunch!\" He is the only other member of the group (along with Kenny) who has actual superpowers.\n*[[Human Kite]] ([[Kyle Broflovski]]) - His (imaginary) superpowers include the ability to fly and \"shoot lasers out of his eyes\".\n*[[Toolshed]] ([[Stan Marsh]]) - Possesses telepathic control over all power tools.\n*[[Mosquito]] ([[Clyde Donovan]]) - Was bitten by a radioactive mosquito and gained mosquito-related superpowers.\n*[[Tupperware]] ([[Token Black]]) - Got into a car accident and was put back together with TupperWear parts.\n*[[Iron Maiden]] ([[Timmy Burch]]) - Is apparently indestructible.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" orientation=\"square\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" widths=\"160\" caption=\"Coon and Friends Members\" spacing=\"small\">\nTheCoon05.jpg|[[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]\nMysterionRises58.png|[[Mysterion]]\nMysterionRises77.png|[[Human Kite]]\nMysterionRises74.png|[[Toolshed]]\nMysterionRises73.png|[[Mosquito]]\nMysterionRises75.png|[[Tupperware]]\nMysterionRises76.png|[[Iron Maiden]]\nMysterionRises78.png|[[Mint-Berry Crunch]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Enemies==\n*[[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] ([[Butters Stotch]]) - Defeated and held in \"The Coon Holding Cell\". He comments that its been six days and The Coon refuses still to give him anything to eat or drink, besides his own feces. Later ruins their reputation on Facebook to prevent them from receiving a franchise.\n*[[General Disarray]] ([[Dougie O'Connell]]) - Seen on their 'biggest bad guys' board in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\".\n*[[Cthulhu]] - A dark god who allied with the Coon and went on a killing spree throughout America, destroying everything Cartman hates. He banishes all of the heroes to another dimension, but he is defeated when Mint Berry Crunch uses his newly discovered godlike powers to overpower Cthulhu and seal him back into his own dimension.\n*[[Cult of Cthulhu]] - Cthulhu's followers, which include [[Peter Nelson]], The [[Goth Kids]], and [[Richard Adler]]. In \"[[Mysterion Rises]]\", they killed Mysterion with a switchblade, but he came back shortly after.\n*[[Captain Hindsight]] - After [[Eric Cartman]] uses fake pictures as blackmail. Due to a combination of blackmail and the pressure of being a hero, he is not Captain Hindsight anymore (he went back to being a news reporter) and therefore not a real threat.\n*[[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] - Formerly their leader, now is out for revenge on his former group for kicking him out. He even went as far as to label the group evil and traitorous, oblivious to the fact that he is the true villain. Eventually defeated when Mint Berry Crunch defeats Cthulhu. He was held in the same cell as Professor Chaos, for a time.\n*[[Herbert Garrison]] - Seen on their 'biggest bad guys' board in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\".\n*[[Mark Zuckerberg]] - Defeated by Coon and Friends during a confrontation with Police on the town's main street.\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Coon and Friends location.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Coon Lair.]]\n{{Main|Coon Lair}}\nKnown as the Coon Lair, the secret headquarters of Coon and Friends are actually located in the basement of [[Cartman Residence]]. \n\nThe entrance to the Coon Lair is passcode protected, which is changed each day in-game. The first passcode for the Coon Lair is obtained inside Cartman's Journal in his bedroom from the mission [[Origins]].\n\nThe passcodes to enter the Coon Lair are as below:\n*307 (FUCK YOU MOM) - On Day 1 (Sunday) in-game.\n*136 (GET SCRAMBLES FAST) - On Day 2 (Monday) in-game.\n*529 (NO GIRLS ALLOWED) - On Day 3 (Tuesday) in-game.\n*561 (RETRIBUTION WITH INCLUSION) - On Day 4 (Wednesday) and onward in-game.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Coon and Friends\">\nSpfbw-characters-header-logo-coon.png|The Coon and Friends Logo\nSuperhero franchise plan.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\"\n*\"[[Mysterion Rises]]\"\n*\"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\"\n*\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\"\n*''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]'' (Coon, Toolshed, Human kite and Mysterion only)\n*''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''\n<!-- Please only include appearances with more than two members. -->\n\n==Trivia==\n*Trey and Matt first conceived of the idea of a superhero team involving the kids while working on \"[[The Coon]]\", as mentioned in the episode's commentary track. It is not known if this was the same as the team that appeared in subsequent episodes. \n*Cartman and Cthulhu become \"Coon and Friend\" in \"[[Mysterion Rises]]\". Cthulhu even has a shirt for it as seen in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\". Cartman apparently trademarked the name \"Coon and Friends\" during this teamp; this was just to give him an excuse to get back at the others.\n*Bradley and Kenny are the only members to actually have superpowers, the rest are just pretending.\n*The Coon and Friends' most common method of dealing with their enemies is apparently locking them in a small cage without anything to eat or drink for long periods of time. They do this to Professor Chaos and The Coon.\n*Tupperware suggested calling the superhero organization the \"Extreme Avenger League\", but was ignored by The Coon.\n*In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', themed music tracks will play depending on the team/area. Coon and Friends' music is inspired by Marvel's ''Avengers'' franchise.\n\n[[es:Coon y Amigos]]\n[[fr:Le coon et sa bande]]\n[[pl:Szop i Przyjaciele]]\n[[zh:浣熊侠联盟（第一代组织）]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Coon and Friends]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
