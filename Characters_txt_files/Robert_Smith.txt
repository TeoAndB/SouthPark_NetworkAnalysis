He appears in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] struggle to defeat the mighty [[Barbra Streisand]], Robert Smith is called in, who, like Maltin and Poitier, can transform into a Japanese ''kaiju'' form. Smith turns himself into a giant Mothra-style kaiju and destroys Mecha-Streisand with a sonic scream and his \"Robert Punch\". Robert Smith lent his voice to his character in \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\".\n\nRobert's monster form is a parody of Mothra, a Toho Studios monster who has appeared in four of her own films as well as several Godzilla films. The twin fairies who appear alongside Mothra, however, were parodied with Poitier rather than with Smith. He appeared in the background of MTV news in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\". He was mentioned in \"[[201]]\".\n\n[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] all appear to be big fans of Smith with Kyle shouting to him that \"Disintegration is the best album ever!\" and Cartman stating \"Robert Smith kicks ass\" (despite being kicked in the nuts by him a few seconds earlier). Even [[Jesus Christ]] proclaims him to be \"Our Savior\".\n\nIn ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' there is an instrumental background song during some of the [[Goth Kids]] tasks that features the main riff to The Cure's song \"A Forest\". Considering The Cure are probably the most famous goth rock band in the world; the goth kids are likely big fans.\n\n==Appearance==\nRobert has messy, black hair, a small nose, and thin, black eyebrows. He wears a light purple button-up shirt with black pants and white sneakers.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Robert Smith\">\nMecha-Streisand094.png|Robert's monstrous form.\nMecha-Streisand090.png|Robert with [[Chef]].\nTimmy2000046.png|Robert in the background of MTV News\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe is heroic, teaming up with [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] to defeat [[Barbra Streisand]] in \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\".\n\n== Prominence ==\n\n* \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\" - Battle with [[Barbra Streisand]] in his Japanese ''kaiju'' form\n* \"[[Timmy 2000]]\" (cameo) - Seeing in the background of MTV News\n* \"[[201]]\" (mentioned)\n\n==Trivia==\n*Smith delivered all of his lines via phone-call and they were all first takes. It is unknown whether he ever actually met Trey Parker and Matt Stone in person.\n*As Smith walks into the sunset, a version of The Cure's \"Let's Go to Bed\" is played on the Japanese Lute (Biwa). \n*Robert Smith had claimed that nothing in his career mattered as much to his younger nephews and nieces as the fact that he was featured on ''South Park ''saying that he is \"''suddenly the coolest uncle\"''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Robert Smith]]\n[[zh:罗伯特·史密斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrity voice actors]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Atheists]]"
