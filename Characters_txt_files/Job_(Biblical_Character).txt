Most scholars believe he is a fictional character created to teach the readers about morals. Job lived in the Ancient Near East and is shown in a flashback in \"[[Cartmanland]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Kyle Broflovski]] pops his hemorrhoid on the barbed wire fence while waiting in line in [[North Park Funland]] which was bought by [[Eric Cartman]], infecting the sore and almost killing him. He is taken to [[Hells Pass Hospital]] where he denounces his faith completely, and [[Gerald Broflovski|his]] [[Sheila Broflovski|parents]]' description of the trials of Job who suffered despite being a good person does little to assure him, only resulting in him believing God is even worse.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Job\">\nCartmanland21.gif|Job in the center, surrounded by local Levantines\n</gallery>\n[[zh:约伯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Religious Figures]]\n[[Category:Religious characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
