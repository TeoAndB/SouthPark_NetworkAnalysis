They appeared in the episode \"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] accidentally said the word \"n*****\" on [[Wheel of Fortune]], he became the pariah of the town. After being caught by the seemingly stereotypical rednecks, it is revealed that they are actually grossly against racism, unlike the stereotypical redneck. They hold Randy up and were presumably going to kill him for \"defiling\" the African-American race. However, before they can do this, [[Michael Richards]], as well as several other Caucasian males who have said \"n*****\", come to Randy's defense. The Hillbilly Brigade is later seen when Randy, Michael Richards, and other \"n*****guys\" were trying to get the word \"n*****guy\" banned. They were seen complaining about how the \"damn n*****guys are being all political right now\".\n\nThey later appear in \"[[Margaritaville]]\" and as part of the protesting rednecks in \"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\n\nEddie wears gray pants and a blue sleeveless shirt, which as a small Confederate flag and his name tag on his left side. He is mostly bald but has orange hair on the sides of his head and shoulder length hair on the back of his head. He has a long orange mustache and wields a large shotgun.\n[[File:1101 hillbilly-brigade.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Hillbilly Brigade driving their truck.]]\nSkeeter wears blue jeans, a belt with a large silver buckle, a white shirt with an American flag design, and a red flannel vest.
