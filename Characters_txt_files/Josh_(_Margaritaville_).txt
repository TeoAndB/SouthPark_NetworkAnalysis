When Stan arrives at the finance company, he is sent in to talk to the boss named Josh, who tells him that he can't return it to them and must go to Wall Street due to the Margaritaville being bought with a payment plan, much to Stan's annoyance.\n\nHe also has a possible girlfriend or wife, as two pictures of a blonde woman can be seen in his office, including one with them riding a jet ski together.\n\n==Appearance==\nJosh has spiked brown hair, brown eyebrows, and has a noticeably orange tan on his skin.
