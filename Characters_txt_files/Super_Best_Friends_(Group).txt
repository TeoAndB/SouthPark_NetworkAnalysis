The group is an obvious parody of ''The Superfriends'' cartoon series, a youth-oriented interpretation of DC Comics' \"Justice League of America\". They first appear in the episode \"[[Super Best Friends]]\".\n\n==Background==\nLed by [[Jesus Christ]] of Christianity, the Super Best Friends is a group of religious icons (and Seaman) who go around the world protecting it from assorted evil threats. Despite the fact that the world uses their faiths as excuses for fighting and war, the members of the Super Best Friends remain just that - Super Best Friends.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Super Best Friends]],\" magician [[David Blaine]] begins to form a cult under his own name called \"Blaintology.\" Among those he converts are the [[The Boys|boys]]. However, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] begins to grow suspicious and leaves the cult, only to be threatened by members of the group. Fearful for his friends who remained behind, Stan seeks out the help of Jesus. However, Jesus' old sleight-of-hand water-to-wine trick is no match, and they then call upon the help of the other Super Best Friends, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends. Together the group goes to Washington DC to stop David Blaine's followers from committing mass suicide in order to gain tax-exempt Status as a supposedly \"legitimate\" religion. In a climactic showdown, they defeat Blaine's trump card, a giant stone [[Abraham Lincoln]], with a giant stone [[John Wilkes Booth]].\n\n[[File:SuperBestFriends044.png|thumb|Muhammad is shown uncensored in the episode \"[[Super Best Friends]]\"]]\nThe group appears again in \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]],\" in which all the [[celebrities]] who ''[[South Park]]'' has ever insulted, threaten to sue the town if they do not hand over Super Best Friend member and Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. However, a problem arises: since the Super Best Friends episode, it has become impossible for anyone, even the Super Best Friends, to show an image of Muhammad anywhere. Stan and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] managed to get Muhammad to go with them to South Park, in a U-haul, but are then forced to take him out of the U-haul as proof that he is really Muhammad.\n\nThey do so but dress him up in a bear costume in the hope that it will work. However, the celebrities and the [[Ginger Separatist Movement]] want to see him out of the costume in order to prove it is really him and not an impostor. However, Stan and Kyle made a promise to not show Muhammad to the Super Best Friends. It is revealed that [[Mr. Hankey]] suggested that they dress up [[Santa Claus]] in the bear costume instead, hoping that no one will notice the difference, due to the fact almost no one has seen Muhammad before, save for Stan, Kyle, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[David Blaine]], and the rest of the Super Best Friends. The plan fails, however, and the Gingers demand the real Muhammad be turned over. Kyle, remembering the incident in which his [[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig|elephant had sex with Cartman's pig]], suggests they try and get [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]] to clone Muhammad like he tried to clone Stan. This plan also fails when the Gingers kidnap all of them.\n\nLater, when [[Barbra Streisand]] attacks [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], the Super Best Friends use their Super Best Friend cycles to get to the town. They defeat Streisand by having [[Krishna]] transform into Neil Diamond and sing a duet with Streisand. They then battle against the Gingers led by [[Scott Tenorman]] and save Cartman and a group of the townsfolk.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Jesus Christ]] - Extremely fast construction, carpentry skills, expert hand-to-hand combatant, resurrection, flight\n*[[Krishna]] - Shapeshifting, flight\n*[[Joseph Smith]] - Ice breath, flight\n*[[Lao Tse]] - Psychic powers, flight\n*[[Muhammad]] - Pyrokinesis, flight, Immunity to being mocked (appears as a black censor bar in future episodes and reruns of [[Super Best Friends]])\n*[[Buddha]] - Invisibility, flight\n*[[Seaman]] and Swallow - Underwater breathing and communication with sea-life, flight\n*[[Moses]] - Supercomputer\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Super Best Friends]]\"\n*\"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[200]]\"\n*\"[[201]]\"\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" (cameo)\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Hall_of_SBF_1.png|thumb|The [[Hall of Super Best Friends]]]]\n*In \"[[200]],\" the Super Best Friends are introduced in an opening sequence similar to ''The Superfriends'' cartoon series.\n*The base of the Super Best Friends is designed to look exactly like the Hall of Justice that appears in both the ''Superfriends'' cartoon and the ''Justice League of America'' comics.\n*[[Krishna]]'s shapeshifting ability is similar to that of Jayna of the Wonder Twins.\n*[[Seaman]] is a parody of DC Comic's Aquaman.\n*[[Joseph Smith]] is the only member of the Super Best Friends that is not Asian, as Jesus and Moses are from Israel, Buddha is from Nepal, Lao Tse is from China, Krishna is from India, and Muhammad is from Arabia.\n*The Super Best Friends cannot help but laugh every time they hear Seaman's name, calling him \"Semen\" instead.\n*The [[Super Best Friends|introduction episode of the Super Best Friends]], as well as \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]]\" has been removed from [[South Park Studios]], due to the threats made against [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] involving Muhammad.\n*[[Buddha]] is revealed to have a cocaine problem, while [[Jesus]] Christ is addicted to pornography.\n[[File:2401 SuperBestFriends.png|200px|thumb|The Super Best Friends on Stan's lunchbox]]\n*In [[I'm a Little Bit Country]], The Super Best Friends were seen singing the reprise of [[Bleeding Heart Rock Protest Song vs. Pro War Country Song]] except for Moses and Muhammad. Obviously, Muhammad was not shown again because this happened just after the creators received controversy about showing him on TV but it is unknown why Moses was not seen.\n*In \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" before heading to school, Stan holds a lunchbox depicting the Super Best Friends including uncensored [[Muhammad]]. They can also be seen in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" on the same lunchbox.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[es:Súper Mejores Amigos (grupo)]]\n[[zh:超级好朋友（组合）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Religious Figures]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
