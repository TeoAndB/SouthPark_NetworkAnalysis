He first appeared in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\", and is voiced by [[Matt Stone]]. His first name was revealed in \"[[Chickenpox]]\".\n\n==Background==\nBeing a heavy alcoholic, Stuart is drunk most of the time. He is shown to often argue and abuse his wife, but it appears to go both ways, as in some episodes [[Carol McCormick|Carol]] berates him without direct provocation. Although he and his wife have been shown physically abusing each other, it has never been shown or implied that Stuart abuses his children. When he is sober, he is very loving and caring to his wife. In \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", the two of them decided to have another child. When Kenny, trying to kill the unborn baby, offered his mother a drink, which he had blended a whole bottle of abortion pills into, and she explained that she couldn't take alcohol while pregnant, Stuart offered to drink it for her. He also tried to stop Kenny when he tried to plunge the baby out of his wife and at the end is the one to suggest they name the baby Kenny.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Mysterion Rises]]\" it is revealed that Stuart and his wife had been part of a cult centered around [[Cthulhu]] ten years before the series' events and that he had been with Carol at the time. He and his wife claim to have been extremely drunk while there - something their son does not question. It is also revealed that Kenny, disguised as [[Mysterion]], has been scaring Stuart and Carol not to get high at night, fight as much, and to pay their children allowances.\n\n===Home===\nStuart and his family live in a run-down old bungalow. In \"[[Chickenpox]]\", it is revealed the house was made by Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski]] when they were young. Their car is dismantled in front of the home and is home to stray cats and dogs. Inside it is dirty and stained. The McCormicks do not own much modern technology, as the family video game system is a ColecoVision, which is plugged into a monochrome television. In \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", the North Park Funland commercial is shown in color, implying that somewhere between the episodes \"[[Chickenpox]]\" and \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\", the McCormicks procured a color television. In \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\", they somehow managed to afford a Robot Security Guard to protect Kenny's cremated body. In \"[[The City Part of Town]]\", the house was upgraded on the exterior, and he does seem to care about his house, as he got pissed off at Randy and told him \"I don't want you touching my damn house!\"\n\n===Occupations===\nIn \"[[Chickenpox]]\", it is also mentioned that Stuart used to work in a pizza factory when he was a teenager. He is currently jobless, due in major part to his alcoholism, and he and his family are on welfare, and live mainly off of plain frozen waffles, pop tarts, and bread sandwiches because of this. However, in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\" it is proved that the McCormicks run a Meth lab. In \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\", it was stated by the Bar owners that the McCormick's make Meth for them.\n\n==Appearance==\nIt was presumed this was Kenny's father's first appearance in the Season One episode, \"[[Death]]\". During the commentary on this episode, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone deny it was Stuart McCormick and claim it was another non-related McCormick due to his not wearing the signature red \"Scotch\" cap and having dark brown hair and a goatee mustache.\n\n[[File:StuartSPS.jpg|thumb|left|Stuart on [[South Park Studios]].]]\nStuart has long, messy light brown hair and a brown mustache. He wears a white shirt under a light blue jacket with sleeves going up to his elbow, a black belt with a gray buckle, blue pants and black shoes. He also wears a red cap with a black border and a yellow sign with \"SCOTCH\" written on it. He has several dirt marks on his clothes and on his face and seems to have something that looks like a chain in his left pocket that goes up to the belt. When sleeping he wears dark blue pajamas.\n\nOn special occasions he wears a denim jacket over his shirt, but in later seasons he wore a brown tuxedo, white dress shirt, red bow-tie and blue pants.\n\nIn \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\", he is seen wearing a bandana without his hat, a fancy sleeveless shirt, white cowboy shoes, and blue pants.\n\nAfter [[Season Thirteen]], his character design model was re-polished, like many other characters. He now has two brown cloths sewn onto his coat in place of the yellow stickers.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Stuart McCormick}}\n\n==Family==\nStuart's surname suggests Irish and/or Scottish ancestry.\n\n===[[Carol McCormick]]===\nShe is Stuart's wife and mother of [[Kevin McCormick|Kevin]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and [[Karen McCormick|Karen]]. Little is known of their past, but they have been together for at least ten years, likely as old as their elder son, and share a love of drinking and drugs.\n\nStuart is shown to care deeply for his wife, when he is sober. When drunk, he and his wife frequently argue and get into domestic squabbles, although it seems to be reinforced that they do care about each other, particularly in \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Insecurity]]\", he mentions \"If you found out '''my''' wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want to you tell me\".\n\n===[[Kevin McCormick]]===\nKevin is Stuart's elder son. He appears to be as old as [[Shelly Marsh]], therefore being around thirteen years old. His relationship with Stuart tends to be strained, enough so that during a drunken fight with Stuart, both he and his wife are arrested.\n\n===[[Kenny McCormick]]===\nKenny is Stuart's younger son. Stuart is shown to care for Kenny, as he plays catch with him in \"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\".\n\nIn ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', when the army is shown singing, Stuart has a picture of Kenny on his helmet.\n\nIn \"[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]\", Stuart was seen to be shocked and mortified at Kenny's deceased remains, which further reinforces his love and care for his son.\n\nIn '[[Cripple Fight]]', he also gets shocked when nude pictures of Kenny were shown on television, which were taken by the Scout Leader.\n\n===[[Karen McCormick]]===\nKaren was seen with the McCormick's in the hospital in \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\", she had no speaking lines.\n\nShe made a second appearance in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\". Her name was confirmed by [[Matt Stone]]. Stuart's relationship with Karen has not been expanded on so it is unclear how he views her as a father.\n\n===[[Grandpa McCormick]]===\nIn \"[[Fat Camp]]\", while performing on the \"Krazy Kenny Show\", Kenny gave his grandfather a Swedish massage. The old man's name was not given, so it is unclear whether he is Stuart's father or father-in-law.\n\n==Interactions==\nStuart frequently hangs out with the other local men at the bar. Being the father of one of the main characters, he is closest to [[Randy Marsh]], [[Gerald Broflovski]], and [[Stephen Stotch]]. Although, he is not as relevant as the other fathers.\n\n===[[Randy Marsh]]===\nMentioned in '[[Cripple Fight]]', it was said that Stuart and Randy used to go to Boy Scouts when they were younger. Randy and Stuart are seen mostly in the pub together, and they seem to tolerate each other. In \"[[The City Part of Town]]\", he gets angry at Randy for insulting him, saying how his house 'sucks'.\n\n===[[Gerald Broflovski]]===\nStuart and Gerald used to be best friends in high school, until Gerald started to get better grades, while Stuart's grades declined.\n\nIn \"[[Chickenpox]]\", [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] and Carol arranged a fishing date for their husbands, in hopes that the old friendship could be restored. The outing went awry when the two of them argued over their views on each other which eventually turned into a fistfight. They made up at the end of the episode.\n\n==Quotes==\n'''Stuart:''' (talking to Cartman dressed as a cop) It's just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend, and our two kids. And my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob who I met last year.\n<br />'''Cartman:''' (to the camera) Poor people tend to live in clusters.\n<br />'''Stuart:''' What? What did you say?\n\n==Video Games==\nStuart can be found in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' outside [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails]]. [[The New Kid]] has to destroy some trash in order to wake him up, and then he can walk to him and get a friend request on Facebook.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - He and [[Carol McCormick|his wife]] cheer [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] on while he's fishing for a can of preserved food.\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" - Briefly seen at [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails]].\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\" - Stuart and his wife are shown fighting when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], as a police officer, investigates on them.\n*\"[[Chickenpox]]\" - Stuart and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] go on a fishing trip in an effort to restore their old friendship.\n*\"[[Spookyfish]]\"\n*\"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" - Remind's Kenny to bring home some left over Turkey.\n*\"[[Spontaneous Combustion]]\" - Goes to Kenny's funeral.\n*\"[[Jakovasaurs]]\" - Seen watching football at the [[Marsh Residence|Marsh residence]].\n*\"[[Chinpokomon]]\" - Seen with other parents at the Marsh residence.\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]] - Stuart participates in the war re-enactment.\n*\"[[Are You There God?

He and Gerald Broflovski built a clubhouse in their earlier years, which became the house the McCormicks now live in.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n{{McCormick Family}}\n[[de:Stuart McCormick]]\n[[es:Stuart McCormick]]\n[[fr:Stuart McCormick]]\n[[it:Stuart McCormick]]\n[[zh:斯图尔特·麦考密克]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:McCormick Family]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]\n[[Category:Cthulhu cult followers]]\n[[Category:Supporting characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
