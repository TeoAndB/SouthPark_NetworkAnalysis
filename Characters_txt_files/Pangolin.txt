"{{South Park character\n|name = Pangolin\n|image = Non-human-animal-pangolin-cc.png\n|wikipedia = [[wikipedia:Pangolin|Pangolin]]\n|appearance = \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Pangolin''', also known as a \"'''Scaly Anteater'''\", is an animal belonging to the order ''Pholidota'' found mostly in Asia and Africa and was suspected to be the headway to the possible cure for COVID-19. The Pangolin appears prominently in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] believes he started the [[COVID-19]] pandemic from having intercourse with a [[bat]] in [[China]], he watches a news report where a group of pandemic specialists was able to find out where the virus started, revealing that it started not from a bat, but rather from a Pangolin. Randy realizes that he also had intercourse with the Pangolin and sets out to [[South Park Viral Research Center]] to steal the pangolin from the specialists so he doesn't get caught.\n\nThe specialists soon find out that the Pangolin was stolen and set out to find it so they can get a cure for the pandemic. Later on, Randy brings the Pangolin to [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] so the specialists can find the cure, but it is taken by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who was about to put it through the Do-Over A Bear machine at the workshop so he doesn't have to go back to school. However, he spares the Pangolin's life after [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] gives a speech about wanting the world to go back to normal. He gives the Pangolin back to the head specialist, but both the specialist and the Pangolin were set on fire and killed by [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] with a flamethrower, who asks people to vote for him as the South Park residents run and scream in fear.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-Four}}\n[[ja:センザンコウ]]\n[[zh:穿山甲]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
