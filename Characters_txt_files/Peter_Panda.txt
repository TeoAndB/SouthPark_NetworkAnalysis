It first appeared in \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" but made its last appearance in \"[[1%]]\" after it was burned in a house fire.\n\n==Background==\nPeter Panda was destroyed in a fire during the events of \"[[1%]]\" by [[Polly Prissypants]], who in reality was Cartman's subconscious projecting itself on to Polly Prissypants. This was brought on by pressure from peers and his mother to grow out of his stuffed animals. The fire not only destroyed Peter Panda, but damaged Eric's room and other sections of his house. He then took the surviving stuffed animals to [[Token Black]]'s house to seek refuge as he was not consciously aware that he himself was destroying his own toys.  Peter was last seen being taken by the fireman as evidence but not before telling Cartman to stay cool, it isn't known if he got a back and put it in a coffin like [[Clyde Frog]].\n\n==Appearance==\nPeter Panda is a toy panda bear with the usual features of a panda such as white body and black accents. He also has pink ears.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Peter Panda\">\nPeterPandaTeaParty.png|Peter Panda at Cartman's tea party.\n0113 09.jpg|Peter Panda at Cartman's tea party in \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\".\nS15E1200013.png|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] cries to his stuffed toys including Peter Panda in \"[[1%]]\".\nS15E1200049.png|Peter Panda during the fire which lead to its fate.\nS15E1200052.png|Peter Panda and a devastated Eric Cartman after the fire.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n* \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" - Seen at Cartman's tea party.\n* \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\" - Seen at the basement of Cartman's house.\n* \"[[1%]]\" - Cartman finds comfort in his stuffed toys.
