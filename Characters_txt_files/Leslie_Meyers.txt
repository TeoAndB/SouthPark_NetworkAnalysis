She made her first appearance in the episode, \"[[Ginger Kids]]\" and was then killed by [[PC Principal]] in \"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" after she is exposed as a self-aware advertisement in human form.\n\n==Background==\nLeslie is always habitually caught by [[PC Principal]] chatting with [[Girl with Pink Coat|her friend]] during school assemblies; this has become a recurring joke throughout Season 19. She was even called out when she stopped chatting before the assembly in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" and reported to police in \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\", during the closing scene, it is revealed that PC Principal and Leslie may have some affiliation with each other.\n\nIn \"[[Sponsored Content]]\", she interviews [[Jimmy Valmer]] at the [[Newsmen|Newsmen's]] headquarters and says she is \"special\", she asks if he is \"special\" too. Jimmy then figures out Leslie is a human advertisement and becomes angry with the salesmen asking if she knows this as well.\n\nIn \"[[Truth and Advertising]]\", she escapes the Newsmen with Jimmy's assistance when he realizes they want to boil her alive to hide the truth. However, this turns out to be a trick, and she then beats up Jimmy to carry out [[Nathan|Nathan's]] plan.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe has long, black hair that is similar to [[Jenny Simons]]'s in appearance with bouncy ends. Formally, her hair is brown and straight. She wears a yellow shirt with a black and white robot head on it (similar in appearance to the Reddit alien mascot, Snoo), green pants, and a large yellow headband. After being 'murdered' by [[PC Principal]], her head is shown to be filled with a strange glowing blue liquid and machinery.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Leslie Meyers\">\nbrownhairedLeslie.png|Leslie's first appearance in [[Ginger Kids]].\nTheCissy-00064.png|Leslie listening to [[Lorde]].\nLeslie.png|[[PC Principal]] telling Leslie to shut up.\nLeslieinYoureNotYelping.png|Leslie in the Hallway\nleslie.jpg|Leslie in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\".\nSponsoredContent069.png|Speaking with [[Jimmy Valmer]].\nLeslieSouthPark1.png\nTruthAndAdvertising080.png|With [[Nathan]].\nTruthAndAdvertising091.png|Shivering at [[Kyle Broflovski]].\nLeslie & PC Principal.png|PC Principal pushing Leslie on the swing.\nPCPrincipalFinalJustice043.png|\"Don't worry, Leslie.

She is also very manipulative, as she emotionally manipulates both Jimmy and Kyle into helping her, even pretending to be attracted to the latter in order to advance her plans. Despite her robotic mannerisms, she does have some degree of emotion, such as happiness and surprise.\n\n==Abilities==\n===Vocal Manipulation===\nAs an ad, she is shown to be able to perfectly imitate anyone's voice, as shown when she imitates President [[Barack Obama]] in \"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\". Her natural voice is an almost robotic monotone, a clue that she is not as she seems. Also as an ad, she can take human form, and unlike humans, has blue jelly-like blood when PC Principal kills her.\n\n===Manipulation===\nAs an ad, she is also very cunning and manipulative. She successfully turns Jimmy, who is fully aware of her essence, into helping her escape from the Newsmen. Even the perfectly calm and rational Kyle was completely convinced that Leslie was not an ad.\n\n===Jamming===\nLeslie can interrupt transmissions and insert ads in media. She uses this power to distract the Newsmen, making them unable to surveil so that she can have enough time to entice Jimmy.\n\n===Strength===\nLeslie is shown to be incredibly strong, able to beat Jimmy unconscious with punching and break the ceiling open just by throwing Jimmy at the ceiling. She does all of this with no visible signs of stress or even effort. She is also durable enough to briefly withstand an assault from PC Principal.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Jimmy Valmer]]===\nIn her talk with him, he realizes she is an ad after her robotic responses. Despite this, in \"[[Truth and Advertising]]\", Jimmy appears to fall for her tricks and saves her from the [[Newsmen]] after hearing of their murder plans, which nearly gets them both killed. However, she double-crosses him to help [[Nathan]] with the [[Super School News]] paper to carry out her planned attack afterward.\n\n===[[PC Principal]]===\nShe seems to not have a good relationship with PC Principal, with her getting yelled at four times by him for talking to her friend during a school assembly (and a fourth time when she stopped talking before being yelled). However, in \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\", this is revealed as a cover-up for a plot against South Park. In \"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" she is revealed to be a sentient robot ad and is destroyed by PC Principal at [[The South Park Gun Show]].\n\n===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===\nShe came to Kyle at the end of \"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" because she heard how good he was at getting messages across, and because she thought he was cute. Kyle then protects her, and she goes on to trick him into thinking that Jimmy is dead and that PC Principal is the enemy. He then goes on to spread these lies to his friends, and at the South Park Gun Show.\n\n===[[Girl with Pink Coat]]===\nIt is possible that they are best friends, as Leslie is always chatting with her. She seems to chat with her friend all the time, even at school assemblies. It is unknown if she knew Leslie was an ad.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Ginger Kids]]\" (background only)\n*\"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]\" - Seen at the school playground.\n*\"[[The Cissy]]\" (background only)\n*\"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\" - Shown in the gym, chatting with her friend, and told to shut up by PC Principal.\n*\"[[You're Not Yelping]]\" - Seen in hallways; background only.\n*\"[[Safe Space]]\" - Shown in the gym, chatting with her friend, and once again told to stop by PC Principal.\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" - Shown in the gym, this time she stopped chatting after, but still called out by PC Principal during an assembly due to the fact that she was sitting next to her friend.\n*\"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\" - Shown in the gym, again not chatting, but PC Principal calls her out, as well as called the police. In the closing scene of the episode, she is shown to have some affiliation with PC Principal, apparently being involved in some sort of plot to take over the town.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - First speaking role. She is referenced taking the test to determine whether a news story is a piece of real news or an advertisement in disguise. As she talks with Jimmy, Jimmy realizes that she is actually an advertisement herself, and not a person. It is not revealed if she knows she's an ad.\n*\"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" - She pulls an ad for cars to tell Jimmy that the newsmen want to boil her alive. Jimmy helps her escape from the newsmen when she tells him they plan to boil her alive. Despite this, she beats up Jimmy in order to edit the school paper. She later goes to Kyle's house and promises to tell him what is going on.\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" - She tricks Kyle into thinking that PC is the enemy. She is later murdered by PC Principal at the South Park Gun Show, ending her quest to stop the world from being rid of ads.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[es:Leslie Meyers]]\n[[fr:Leslie Meyers]]\n[[id:Leslie Meyers]]\n[[it:Leslie Meyers]]\n[[ja:レズリー・マイヤーズ]]\n[[pl:Leslie Meyers]]\n[[zh:莱斯利·迈尔斯]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Female 4th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by April Stewart]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]"
