However, despite his confidence, the [[Adams County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]] proves to be just as inexperienced and unable to play as the [[Park County Pee-Wee Hockey Team]], which suggests that Gavin may be an inexperienced coach.\n\n==Appearance==\nGavin has combed brown hair and wears a white collared shirt with a red tie. On top of that he wears a collared black suit. He also wears grey pants and black shoes. Plus, his facial expression is always one of arrogance and confidence. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n[[zh:加文·斯洛托]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]"
