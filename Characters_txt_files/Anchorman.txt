He is portrayed by South Park editor Tom Vogt.\n\n==Background==\nAfter each successive commercial break, after the first, the Anchorman would say variations of the phrase, \"fighting the frizzies at 11\". During the episode's credits, he fights a \"frizzie\" in a boxing match.\n\nThis is a take on a real promo spot for a newscast that's almost identical and that can be seen on most bootleg versions of \"The Star Wars Holiday Special\".\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Anchorman has combed darkish brown hair and a brown mustache. He wears a black suit coat, a white formal shirt, and a blue striped tie. He also wears white boxer shorts with a black trim.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[fr:Anchorman]]\n[[zh:电视主持人（汉基先生的圣诞特辑）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Realistic characters]]"
