The last character he is shown to have performed surgery on is Kyle's father, [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]], where he performs a \"dolphinplasty\" on him to turn him into a dolphin.\n\nLater on, Dr. Biber helps Ms. Garrison to find her balls, which he had placed inside Kyle's kneecaps for his negroplasty.
