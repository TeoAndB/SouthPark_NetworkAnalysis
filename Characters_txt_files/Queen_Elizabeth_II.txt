The fact that she killed herself when she learned her plan failed could mean she is extremely patriotic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n[[zh:伊丽莎白二世]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]"
