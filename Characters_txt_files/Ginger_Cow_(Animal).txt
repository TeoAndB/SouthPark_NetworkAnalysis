"{{South Park character\n|name = Ginger Cow\n|image = Ginger-cow.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Cattle\n|hair = Red\n|died = \"[[Ginger Cow]]\"\n|appearance = \"[[Ginger Cow]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Ginger Cow''' was a cow that appeared in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[Ginger Cow]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Eric Cartman]] turns a normal cow into a fake red-haired one in order to fool all the children. After successfully fooling them, Cartman admits to [[Kyle Broflovski]] that it is a fake, but does not see anything wrong with the joke. However, it turns out that the \"red heifer\" is part of a real religious prophecy in the religions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Upon learning about its existence, news reporters from around the world kill themselves and religious leaders come to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to worship it. Coming to the conclusion that sacrificing the cow in Israel would bring about world peace, the cow is brought to Israel, via helicopter, and dropped onto a roof, killing it. Followers of the three Abrahamic religions then celebrate.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe ginger cow is a normal cow with painted red spots, freckles, black glasses, a red wig, and horns.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n[[es:Vaca Pelirroja (animal)]]\n[[zh:红发牛（角色）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]"
