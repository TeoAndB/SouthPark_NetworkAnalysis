During a raid against [[The Peppermint Hippo]], the two revealed their true colors when Jenkins shot [[Hopkins]]. Murphy then shot Gino and Jenkins as well so nobody would know of his corruption. Then, reasoning he could not even trust ''himself'', Murphy committed suicide.\n\n==Appearance==\nJenkins wore black pants, a blue shirt with a white collar and a green tie. He has a leather arm holster for his pistol. He also has gray, buzzed hair, and a gray mustache.\n\nMurphy wore brown pants, a white shirt with a red tie, and a leather arm holster. He had a full head of black hair and no facial hair.\n\nBoth detectives wield revolvers.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:SuperFunTime046.png|thumb|right|Jenkins' model as a senior detective in \"Super Fun Time\".]]\n*Nearly identical officers appear in \"[[Super Fun Time]]\", with a gray-haired detective who closely resembles Jenkins, using Detective Yates' body, appearing as the lead sergeant/chief on this occasion. A lieutenant who looks like Murphy, with broader shoulders and a light blue tie, appears later in the same scenes, and made background appearances for some years after alongside Yates' officers.\n*A news reporter who looks almost identical to Murphy appeared in \"[[The Coon]]\"; the similar, broader-shouldered detective resembling him also appears at the episode's conclusion when [[Mysterion]] unmasked himself.\n[[File:SuperFunTime047.png|thumb|left|A detective resembling Murphy.]]\n*In the Mandarin Chinese dub, both detectives are named \"劉賤名\" (Pinyin: ''Liú jiàn míng'') and \"楊緊溶\" (''Yáng jǐn róng''). The names of these detectives, along with that of Hopkins, parody the main characters of the ''[[Wikipedia:Infernal Affairs (film series)|Infernal Affairs]]'' film series.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
