He is a mobster with a gangster's suit.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]\", he runs the local [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] tooth trading business and gets annoyed when [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] muscle in on his \"patch\". He speaks with an accent typical to that of Mafia bosses in the media and consumes a lot of spaghetti and even gets his henchman to try to kill Kenny. He employs tons of people in his business, including [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]. Loogie's tooth trading business falls apart after he decides to join a sports team.\n\nIn \"[[Professor Chaos]]\", he appears as one of the candidates for [[The Boys]]' fourth friend. Although he does not have a speaking line, he does receive a rose to go on to the second round. He is referred to as 'Luigi' by Kyle.\n\n==Appearance==\nLoogie wears a black gangster's suit with a red tie, which is stereotypical of the Mafia popular culture. His hair is black and he is more physically imposing than the majority of the [[The Boys|boys]], but without the obesity present in [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].\n\n==Personality==\nLoogie remains calm in most situations and possesses, or feigns, a cold and cruel personality, to the extreme of trying to murder [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. He communicates with his associates mostly through cell phones. Loogie will revert to a high-pitched voice when talking to adults, trying to hide his Mafia-like personality. It is also likely that this is his normal voice and when he is speaking on the most part, it is a put-on voice.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]\"\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - To be a possible new friend.\n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\" - Seen watching [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle's]] presentation.\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" - At the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins Restaurant]], watching the raisins girls singing and dancing to the song \"[[YMCA]]\".\n*\"[[AWESOM-O]]\" - The top of his head can be seen in the far back row during the video of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - Seen watching Jimmy perform his stand-up comedy.\n*\"[[ManBearPig]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" (cameo) - Seen at the assembly.\n*\"[[Canada on Strike]]\"\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" - Seen briefly when the kids enter the school gym.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Loogie\">\nTheToothFairyTats2000042.png|Loogie in his restaurant.\nTheToothFairyTats2000043.png|Loogie, eating at his restaurant.\nTheToothFairyTats2000087.png|\"Jesus!
