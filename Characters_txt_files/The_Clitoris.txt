"{{South Park character\n|name = The Clitoris\n|image = South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut-24 35167.png\n|gender = Female\n|voice = [[Mary Kay Bergman]]\n|appearance = ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''\n}}\n'''The Clitoris''' appears in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. In the movie, when [[Stan Marsh]] asked [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]] how to make [[Wendy Testaburger]] return his affections for her, he replied, \"Oh, that's easy. You just need to find the Clitoris.\" \n\nIn an futile search to find out what the Clitoris was, and where he could find it, Stan turned to numerous people and places, including [[Kyle Broflovski]] (who didn't know), his sister [[Shelly Marsh]] (who just hit him over the head with a chair), and the internet (which yielded many results that were ultimately unhelpful).\n\nLater on, the Clitoris unexpectedly turns out to be an enormous glowing, talking reproductive organ. Stan stumbles upon her after escaping a heated battle between [[Canada|Canadians]] and [[United States|Americans]]. The Clitoris tells Stan to save [[Terrance and Phillip]], to save the Earth, and also to be confident, because \"chicks love confidence\", in order to win the love of [[Wendy Testaburger]].\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Clitoris is as its name suggests, a giant, pink glowing clitoris.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Clitoris is a parody of Glinda the Good Witch from ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n*In the Japanese dub of the movie, The Clitoris speaks like a woman who is having an orgasm.\n\n{{Minor Characters Movie}}\n[[es:El Cl√≠toris]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Made-up characters]]"
