This gave the police, stationed outside of the village, the opportunity to storm in. All of Franz's gang except for [[Vosky|one man]] were killed and Franz himself was arrested.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe had a goatee and wore a business suit with a striped tie. He also carried what appears to be an M16 and a silenced pistol.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In both name and overall appearance, Franz is a parody of Alan Rickman's character, Hans Gruber, from the movie ''[[wikipedia:Die Hard|Die Hard]]''.\n\n==See Also==\n===Members of The Burger King Bandits===\n*[[Vosky]]\n*[[Female Thief]]\n*[[Domino]]\n*[[Orlich]]\n*[[Injured Thief]]\n*[[Thief with Brown Hair]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n[[zh:弗朗茨]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
