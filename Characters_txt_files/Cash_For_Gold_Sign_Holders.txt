Instead of going after the shop's owners or cashiers, they initially target the sign holders, which includes [[Butters Stotch|Butters]].\n\n[[File:CashForGold052.png|thumb|left|''\"Who ever made the rhyme, did the crime.\"'']]\nDuring the confrontation, both the boys and the sign holders went back and forth between different versions of a Hindu saying, which initially was \"Who ever smelt it, dealt it.\" [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] learned from the executive at the smelter that the saying was actually, \"Who ever denied it, supplied it.\" An individual, holding a pink sign which read, \"Cash 4 Wearing signs 4 CASH 4 GOLD\", corrected both parties by stating that the gold comes from [[India]], where the sayings are created. He then states that \"Who ever made the rhyme, did the crime.\" This indirectly places the blame on the sweatshops in India, who reprocess the gold and gems.\n\n==Appearance==\nAll of the sign holders wear various street clothes, which includes various colored pants, shirts, and shoes. As with real sign holders, some of the Cash For Gold sign holders wear earphones and hats. Each of them holds a sign with variations of \"Cash 4 Gold\" advertisements, for their place of employment.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The sign holder wearing a Statue of Liberty costume is a reference to Liberty Tax, who has their sign holders wear similar costumes.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n[[fr:Cash For Gold Sign Holders]]\n[[zh:当金标志举牌人]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"
