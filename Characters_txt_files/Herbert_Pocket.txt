Pocket had a large collection of baby bunnies, of which [[Estella Havisham|Estella]] killed twenty-five. It is logical to assume he never forgave her for her sins.\n\nHe helps Pip defeat [[Miss Havisham]] and is joyful at the prospect of a happy ending. It is announced at the end of the episode that Pocket died of Hepatitis B, which could lead to the fact that he was too good a boy and accidentally pricked himself on a drug needle through which it was contracted.\n\n==Appearance==\nPocket is a cheerful bloke with combed strawberry blonde hair, large front teeth, and a crooked smile. He wears brown pants, a red vest over a white formal shirt, and a large teal bow tie.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[es:Pocket]]\n[[zh:赫伯特·朴凯特]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]"
