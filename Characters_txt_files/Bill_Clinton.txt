He has made occasional appearances on the show during his presidency, and later afterward as well. He is married to [[Hillary Clinton]] and belongs to the Democratic Party. He was voiced by [[Trey Parker]].\n\n==Appearance==\nFormer President Clinton originally had only white hair and wore a black business suit, with a few wrinkles and small half-lidded eyes. Beginning with \"[[Sexual Healing]]\", his new appearance had gray and white hair with a very wrinkled face and large half-lidded eyes, and a chin. He wore a pink shirt with an indigo sweater-vest over it and gray trousers. He has a very raspy voice. In [[Season Twenty]], he wears a green cardigan sweater over a blue and white checkered shirt, black trousers, and brown shoes.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Bill Clinton\">\nBillclinton.JPG|Bill Clinton addresses the nation in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\nBillClinton314.png|Clinton in \"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\"\nBillclinton1401.png|Bill Clinton as he appears in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nClinton was portrayed as a responsible man who wished to do the best he could for the country, although he tended to fail - he was tricked by the Japanese flattery in \"[[Chinpokomon]]\" and, after appointing [[Sheila Broflovski]] to the fictional position of Secretary of Offense, declared war on [[Canada]] in \"[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\". His Vice President was [[Al Gore]]. He is also shown to be very sexual - he sleeps with [[Liane Cartman]] in his first appearance and, in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\", is part of a program for sex addiction. He even asks Kyle if his \"mom has big tits\" in the same episode - it's unlikely he knew Kyle was Sheila's son.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" - [[Liane Cartman]] sleeps with him to get him to change abortion laws, a reference to his affair with [[White House]] intern Monica Lewinsky.\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\" - He appears when Cartman and the Confederate army march on [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D. C.]] He also gives the boys a history lesson before at the end, pointing out the hollowness of Stan and Kyle's victory - they call him a \"dick\".\n*\"[[Chinpokomon]]\" - He gets flattered by the Japanese, making an address simply to inform everyone he has a large penis.\n*[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]] - Declares war on Canada for killing the Baldwins, and introducing the new \"Secretary of Offense\" [[Sheila Broflovski]]. He is pushed aside by her and he feebly tries to retaliate.\n*\"[[Sexual Healing]]\"- One of the sex addicts in the [[Karne Institute for Sex Addiction]] learning that his sex drive was caused by the [[Wizard Alien]], mentioning \"sticking cigars in girls' vaginas\" and asking Kyle about his mother.\n*\"[[200]]\" - One of the celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen in a photograph on [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton's]] desk.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Along with [[Bill Cosby]], insists all the boys at [[South Park Elementary]] join [[Bill Clinton's Gentleman's Club]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Bill Clinton]]\n[[fr:Bill Clinton]]\n[[ja:ビル・クリントン]]\n[[zh:比尔·克林顿]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
