Principal Victoria asked her if it could be surgically removed, and she said that this could be done but with a risk of her dying. [[The Boys]] are very frightened of her, with [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] leading the parents and the rest of the town to create \"Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week\", which Gollum had found embarrassing. The adults think she's an \"ungrateful bitch\" and doesn't care what people think of her while the kids believe the fetus makes her smarter.\n\n[[File:ConjoinedFetusLady11.png|thumb|left]]\nShe also reappears in \"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" where she examined Van Gelder's behavior and in a parody of ''Star Trek'', takes the role of Nurse Chapel to Mr. Mackey's Mr. Spock. She and he together fought against Dr. Adams' plot. She is also briefly seen as a member of [[True Freaks Union]] (TFU) in \"[[Freak Strike]]\", and then finally in the crowd in \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", her last noticeable appearance - though she made a very brief cameo in \"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\".\n\nShe was voiced by [[Karri Turner]] when she appeared in \"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" as Nurse McSchwartz, with a much more baneful personality annoyed the kids seemed to be faking sick again, before sending them off once Cartman released his flaming gas. She also treats [[Pip Pirrip]] unfairly, telling him to shut up and poorly nursing his injury.\n[[File:Nursegollum-orange-hair.png|thumb|right]]\nIn the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\", a month after [[Mary Kay Bergman]]'s suicide, Nurse Gollum was one of several characters who appeared as a tribute to her during the line \"Faithful friends who are dear to us - Gather near to us once more.\", She was one of many characters who were cutout standees in 2020-2021 [[Denver Broncos]] games.\n\nShe makes background appearances in the [[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" after vanishing from the show for many seasons. A nurse similar to her is also seen celebrating the end of the pandemic at the end of the episode, however, she had orange hair and in place of the dead fetus there is a blood mark.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe wears a long, white nurse coat with a gold-colored name tag on the left side and a white cap with the red cross. She haves round pink hair with short bangs and also a still-born fetus attached to her head from birth.\n\n==Prominence==\n[[File:Shut_up_pip.png|thumb|Nurse McSchwartz without the Fetus on her head in [[The Unaired Pilot]].]]\n\n*[[The Unaired Pilot]] - Neglects Pip in the nurse’s office and gets freaked out by Eric’s fire farting problem.\n*\"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" - The mayor dedicates a whole week to her about the fetus on her head and is the main focus in this episode. \n*\"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" - Attempts to recover [[Van Gelder]] from his hypnosis.\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (Cameo)\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Freak Strike]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" (Cameo)\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen running after [[the boys]] for the [[COVID-19 Vaccine]] and later seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Marygollumposter.png|right|thumb|Nurse Gollum's missing poster in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.]]\n*In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', there is a poster of her saying that she is missing since October 19 in the police station, it is reference to her latest appearance at the time, \"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" which aired on October 19. She eventually returned in \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\".\n**The poster also reveals that her first name is Mary, that she is 33 years old, and weighs 130lbs (pounds).\n*In \"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\", she did not have the dead fetus on her head, and her surname was McSchwartz.\n*She is shown to have an interest in cats; as seen in one of her \"tribute\" slides, there is a picture of a cat on her wall, and she is also putting together a puzzle of a cat.\n*She is one of many residents of South Park who was at the September 2020 Buccaneers vs. Broncos NFL game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AllbrightNFL/status/1310248379272761346|title=@AllbrightNFL on Twitter.}}</ref>\n*While it is possible (albeit rare) to have a conjoined twin attached to one's head, \"conjoined twin myslexia\" is an entirely fabricated term. In real life, they are simply called conjoined twins.\n*The fetus has black hair, so it is possible that Nurse Gollum’s hair is naturally black and she just dyes it pink.\n*When she mentions that surgery to have the fetus removed might kill her, it is likely that the fetus is attached to her brain. Removing the fetus might cause potentially fatal brain damage.\n*Due to her age and the fetus being dead, it has a shriveled and somewhat elderly appearance, rather than the youthful appearance of a typical fetus. Also, fetuses typically do not have hair.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n[[es:Enfermera Gollum]]\n[[ja:ゴーラム看護師]]\n[[ru:Сестра Голлум]]\n[[zh:玛丽·古鲁姆]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mary Kay Bergman]]\n[[Category:Medics]]\n[[Category:Former school faculty]]"
