He was mainly a filler in the classroom throughout the first three seasons, but since \"[[Fourth Grade]]\", he only appears occasionally in large groups or in the playground, gymnasium, or hallway.\n\n==Background==\nOriginally in \"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\", he was seen rolling around in what appears to be a puddle of mud or dog feces during recess with the prototype [[Token Black|Token]] watching him. Later, in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\", he, along with [[Francis]], is one of Mayor [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s Assistants.\n\nHe had his first speaking role in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\". He was a possible replacement for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and lamented his status as a supporting character, but didn't survive the first cut. Cartman described him as \"more of a prop\". He reappeared in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" as part of Cartman's entourage against [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. He is the only member besides [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to have lines, yelling ''\"GET IT OFF OF ME!\"'' when [[Snooki]] rapes him. He makes two appearances in [[Season Fifteen]]. First is in \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\" when he stays with the boys indoors. He re-appears in \"[[1%]]\" and is seen behind [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] during P.E. His last name was revealed to be Petuski in \"[[T.M.I.]]\".\n\n===Dirt===\nOne of DogPoo's main features is his dirt and mess all over him, he might do this on purpose though, as he rolls around in mud/dog poo in [[The Unaired Pilot]]. He has dirt in his hair, clothes, and on his face. He also has a scab on his cheek. His parents look normal and clean, which means DogPoo probably just likes being dirty.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has messy, faded brown hair, and wears a messy brown jacket with dark green trousers or track pants. He has a mark on the right side of his jaw that may be a large mole, scab, or dirt stain, similar to Pig-Pen from ''Peanuts'', or actual dog poo. On the left side of his jaw, he has a scratch. His relatively deep voice has a slight Canadian/English twang to it in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nDespite being covered in dirt and having a messy appearance, DogPoo is quite sophisticated, speaking in an accent with a slight Canadian/English twang to it. The other kids and adults treat him like everyone else, not even pointing out all his dirt. He also is a bit of a follower, blindly following [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] orders in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\". He is also self-aware of his minor appearance and little interaction with [[the boys]], saying \"I've been around these guys for like, five years, and never got to say or do anything.\"\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nDogPoo can be seen in the Elven Kingdom, where he sends the player on a [[Restoring the Balance|quest]] to destroy some Kupa Keep banners placed in the Elven Territory.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nDogPoo can be found near the trash at the [[Basketball Court|basketball court]], and eagerly accepts [[The New Kid]] as a friend.\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"120\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\ndogpoogencard.png|'''Dogpoo'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nDog Poo Sitting in Weight Gain 4000.PNG|DogPoo sitting in class in \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\".\nDogpoo.jpg|DogPoo on [[South Park Studios]].\nDogPooPetuski.png|''\"I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.\"'' (\"[[Professor Chaos]]\").\nJerseything89.png|DogPoo being raped by Snooki in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\".\nDogPooWithAGun.png|DogPoo in \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\".\nScreenshot.png|DogPoo sitting next to Cartman in \"[[Cartmanland]]\".\nDogPooFamily.png|Dogpoo and his family in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\".\nDOGPOO.png|Dogpoo rolling in the mud in ''[[The Unaired Pilot]]''.\nDogpoo jason and kahl.png\nDog Poo.png\nDogpoopitdown.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Seen rolling around in a puddle mud or dog feces with Token near him.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - Seen in the classroom.\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" - Seen sitting in class with other students.\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Seen in the classroom.\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Seen as a member of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]].\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" - Seen at the dance.\n*\"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\" - Seen with his family.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Seen as a part of the crowd at Cartman and [[Scott Tenorman|Scott]]'s public video viewings.\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Seen in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria]].\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - First speaking appearance.\n*\"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\" - Seen on the playground as [[Rob Schneider]] rides the hobby elephant in the ''Rob Schneider Is Kenny'' trailer.\n*\"[[Toilet Paper]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\" - Appeared watching [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s presentation.\n*\"[[Raisins]]\"\n*\"[[Casa Bonita]]\" - Seen talking to [[Craig Tucker]].\n*\"[[AWESOM-O]]\" - Seen watching the video of Cartman dressed as [[Britney Spears]].\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" - Seen at the assembly.\n*\"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" - Can be seen walking with [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] before the class starts.\n*\"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\" - Briefly seen in the background in the hallway.\n*\"[[Fatbeard]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" - Part of Cartman's entourage to help lock up Kyle.\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\"\n*\"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\" - Seen playing [[Texans vs. Mexicans]] with the other boys.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Seen at the assembly and in the gymnasium.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in [[Make Bullying Kill Itself|Stan's Anti Bullying Video]]\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\" - Seen playing [[Sarcastaball (Sport)|Sarcastaball]].\n*\"[[Raising the Bar]]\" - Seen in the gym when Cartman talks about anorexia.\n*\"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]\" - Seen in the playground.\n*\"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\" - Seen in [[Park County Community Center]] sitting between [[Bebe Stevens]] and [[Red McArthur]].\n*\"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" - Seen playing basketball in the burnt down gym.\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\"\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen in the battle between the boys and the girls.\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of [[Heidi Turner|Heidi's]] bedroom.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Singing \"[[Put It Down (Song)|Put It Down]]\" at the end.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Seen at Marcus's birthday party.

In \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\", he can be seen in the bus for mentally handicapped kids. He was also seen sitting in a hospital in \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\", possibly indicating that he believed in [[Mr. Hankey]]. He is seen again in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\".\n*In \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\", DogPoo is seen as a member of the boys' inner group for the first time.\n*DogPoo is a clear homage to Pigpen from ''Peanuts''. He is constantly dirty (represented visually with crosshatching), his hair is very messy, his clothes are the same color, and the format of his name is similar.\n*Since \"[[Fourth Grade]]\", he did not make any appearance in the classroom.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[es:DogPoo Petuski]]\n[[fr:DogPoo Petuski]]\n[[it:DogPoo Petuski]]\n[[ja:ドッグプー・ペッタスキー]]\n[[pl:DogPoo Petuski]]\n[[ru:Дог-Пу Петуски]]\n[[zh:狗屎·帕图斯基]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Drow Elves members]]\n[[Category:Lil' Qties]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Quest Givers]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
