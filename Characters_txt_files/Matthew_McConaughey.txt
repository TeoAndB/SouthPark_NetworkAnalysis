However, later when he's competing in ''Wacky Races'', McConaughey appears driving a Zipcar, saying, just like with the Handicar, that he \"was driving a ZipCar way before [he] got paid to drive one\". At the end of the race, McConaughey tries to catch up to [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s Handicar, which is in the lead; however, explosives that were set by [[Mimsy]], which were intended for Timmy's Handicar, were actually set under McConaughey's Zipcar. This happens because Mimsy mistook the \"fake, soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves\" to be McConaughey, rather than Timmy, which angers [[Nathan]]. The explosives go off, ripping open a wormhole that sucks McConaughey in, allowing Timmy to win the race.\n\n==Appearance==\nMatthew McConaughey has combed brown hair and wears a black business suit, which includes a black coat, a white shirt, and a black tie.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eighteen}}\n[[es:Matthew McConaughey]]\n[[zh:马修·麦康纳]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
