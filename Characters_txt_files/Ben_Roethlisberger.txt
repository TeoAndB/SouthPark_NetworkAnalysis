However, rather than admitting to their own faults and poor judgment, the center instead places the blame on the fact that they got CAUGHT cheating, and does not bother to teach them to control their impulses.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears a white, number 7 Pittsburgh Steelers football jersey with yellow stripes on the sleeves, a blue pair of pants and black shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nHe may be unintelligent, believing that the [[Wizard Alien]] must be behind his abnormal sex drive.
