He is voiced by [[Matt Stone]], and later by [[Trey Parker]]. He claims to be from the seventh layer of hell. His only two speaking appearances to date were in the eponymous episode \"[[Damien]]\" and in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Damien]]\", he joins [[The Boys|the boys]]' class as the new student at [[South Park Elementary]]. He introduces himself as the son of [[Satan]], a claim which is completely ignored by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], despite his obvious evil powers. Damien is rejected from sitting with the main characters during lunch, and is taunted by [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]. Outraged, he turns Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, then demands to speak to [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]].\n\nDamien's father, Satan, challenges Jesus to a boxing match, and everyone in town switches their bets to Satan, realizing Jesus doesn't even stand a chance. One bet on Jesus remains, secretly placed by Satan himself. Initially, Jesus is horribly beaten, but Satan throws the fight, allowing Jesus to win in order to get everyone's money. Damien then returns to Hell alongside his father, claiming that he only performs evil because he has to. As Damien leaves, Stan and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] briefly lament that he will never be able to gain acceptance because he's always on the move.\n\nSince then, Damien has appeared in the background of various episodes. He was also seen in the movie theater with other children watching ''[[Asses of Fire|Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire]]'' in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\n\n==Appearance==\nDamien's appearance is fairly plain as he only wears plain black pants and a black long-sleeve shirt. He has eyebrows in the shape of lightning bolts. He has long black wavy hair and does not wear gloves. When he gets upset, his pupils give of a fire effect.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Damien\">\nDamien.jpg|Damien's picture on [[South Park Studios]].\n108_00004.jpg|Damien as the newest classmate in \"[[Damien]]\".\n108_00005.jpg|\"''Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels!

Though Damien doesn't like Pip, the two are seen together throughout the episode. Pip shows empathy for Damien, claiming that he \"knows what it's like being the new kid\". Following Pip's advice, Damien goes into counseling with [[Mr. Mackey]], who tells him to be passive and \"overly nice\". Damien tries this with the boys, but is consequently farted on and called 'Fart Boy'. He tells Pip, who is delighted at the thought of losing that nickname to Damien. \n\n[[File:108_00017.jpg|thumb|Damien and his new friend [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]].]]\nDamien and Pip were the only boys not invited to Cartman's birthday party. While sitting on the street, Damien asks Pip if he has always been hated. Pip replies that he has, and that Cartman is also hated, but is accepted by the others for teasing Pip. This gives Damien an idea. Damien takes Pip to Cartman's party and as a gift, sends Pip flying in the air before making him explode. Pip is then seen falling to the ground, where he lands safely in the snow, apparently having enjoyed the experience. This wins Damien's acceptance, and he and Pip are never seen together again.\n\n==Video Games==\n====''[[South Park Rally]]''====\nDamien serves as an unlockable character in the game South Park Rally. He is unlocked by completing the Millennium New Years race without having anyone else collect the Millennium Key except for the player.\n\n====''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''====\nDamien plays a minor role in the game, remaining in the theater during the entire game, where he speaks out against [[Rob Schneider]]. He will be added to the player's friend list if spoken to. There was multiple 'Missing' posters for him throughout the town, referencing his lack of attendance in the show. His voice seems to have changed from his speaking appearance to a more standard one, unlike his original high-pitched one.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nDamien can be seen on posters for him throughout the town, referencing his lack of attendance in the show.\n\n=== ''South Park (Unreleased Game Boy Color game):'' ===\nDamien serves as a boss in the game South Park (GBC), Damien's attacks are throwing snowballs, the player must attack him by using snowballs\n\n==Prominence==\n[[File:Damien1502.png|thumb|Damien's cameo in \"[[Funnybot]]\".]]\nAfter his initial appearance, Damien was written out of ''South Park'' story-wise, aside from a prominent cameo in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\" as a possible fourth friend, and even is seen holding a rose despite not being called up for one. He still reappears in the background periodically as an animator easter egg, generally once or twice per season, although in recent years he has seen increasing use in scenes taking place in the school gymnasium. Damien gets a speaking role for the first time in 16 years, since his first appearance, in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', where he is seen inside the movie theater watching various trailers.\n\n*\"[[Damien]]\" - Debut appearance. He becomes a new student of the school. This is his only prominent appearance. He is the central antagonist of this episode.\n*\"[[Gnomes]]\"\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - (Cameo). Seen watching the ''Terrance and Phillip'' movie.\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - He is a candidate for the new fourth friend.\n*\"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\" - Seen at the camp when the children first arrive.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\"\n*\"[[Grey Dawn]]\" - Seen when Randy goes to warn the town \n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" - Seen in the assembly.\n*\"[[AWESOM-O]]\" - Seen laughing in the crowd when a video of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] as [[Britney Spears]] in \"[[Touch My Body]]\" was shown.\n*\"[[Douche and Turd]]\"\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - Seen watching the South Park Elementary Talent Show.\n*\"[[Smug Alert!]]\" - Seen eating cake at Kyle's \"farewell party\".

Dominus... Cheesy Poofs...\", \"rectus dominus\" is cod Latin for \"ass master\", an insult often used on the show, and [[Cheesy Poofs]] are Cartman's favorite snack. Additionally, \"rectus dominus\" is heard in the song \"Spooky Mormon Hell Dream\", a song from The Book of Mormon, a Broadway musical by Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez.\n*Damien was originally going to be voiced by ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' and ''King of the Hill'' creator and voice actor [[Mike Judge]]. Due to the fast production on ''[[South Park]]'', however, Judge was unable to record new lines. Judge later did the voice of the unhooded Kenny in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\n*He was originally going to have a supporting role in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'', but this was cut from the film. However, he can still be seen in the theater when the boys see ''Asses of Fire'' for the second time.\n*Damien is featured in the game ''[[South Park Rally]]''.\n*In \"[[Funnybot]]\", Damien can be seen in the crowd with his old-style eyebrows, the only fourth grader to maintain unusual eyebrows past the fourth season.\n*In \"[[T.M.I.]]\", his surname is revealed to be Thorn (the same last name as the character from ''The Omen'') via a chart published by the school. He does not appear in the actual episode, however.\n*In various episodes, a kid similar looking to Damien in a blue shirt and brown hair can be seen sitting the back of [[The 4th Grade|the classroom]].\n*In one instance, Damien can be seen wearing a green shirt rather than his usual black one at Cartman's party in \"[[Smug Alert!]]\".\n*Despite moving away in the same episode he was introduced in, Damien appears to have moved back to South Park and no longer lives with Satan, not being aware of or involved in any of his future plans.\n*Though he is the son of Satan, Damien may also have a mother. Stan tells him that Kenny saw her drop him off at school and that she is \"a real dog\".\n*In his debut episode, he was supposed to be the original murderer of Pip Pirrip when he was blown up, according to the commentary for that episode, rather than Mecha-Streisand in \"[[201]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[de:Damien Thorn]]\n[[es:Damien Thorn]]\n[[fr:Damien Thorn]]\n[[ja:ダミアン・ソーン]]\n[[ru:Дэмиен Торн]]\n[[zh:达米安·索恩]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
