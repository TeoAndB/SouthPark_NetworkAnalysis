He then tells him that if he kills all the dire bears, he can help him.\n\nWhen the New Kid is done killing the dire bears, he takes the pelts back to the Earl. The Earl then thanks him and tells him that the one who translate it for him is the [[Minister of Montreal]]. After the New Kid leaves to tell the Prince, the Earl looks at the pelts and says, \"Boy, oh boy. I will have the most dire robe in all of Canada.\"\n\nThe Earl will then friend the New Kid on Facebook.\n\n==Appearance==\nLike most Canadians, he has beady eyes and a flapping head. He is balding, with a black mustache and mutton chops, and wears a blue uniform.\n\n[[zh:温尼伯伯爵]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Video Game Exclusive characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
