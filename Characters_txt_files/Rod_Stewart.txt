When Stewart is brought in by [[Nurse with Red Hair|his nurse]], Jesus is shocked to see the state he is in. He is wheelchair-bound, barely able to mumble his words, and suffers from fecal incontinence where he frequently \"poops his pants\". He is very dependent on his nurse who treats him in a very undignified, condescending manner.\n\nAt the millennium concert, Stewart is barely able to sing; he can only mumble \"O-oh\".

The audience gets very upset and prepares to crucify Jesus once more.\n\nRod Stewart also appears in the background of \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]]\" as one of the celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n\n==Appearance==\nHe looks very elderly, with an extreme amount of facial wrinkles, sunken-in cheeks, liver spots, as well as being confined to a wheelchair.
