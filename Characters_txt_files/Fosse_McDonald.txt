Similar to ''Beavis and Butthead'', Fosse often calls things \"gay\" followed by laughing in a deep voice.\n\n==Appearance==\nFosse wears a purple shirt similar to [[Terrance Mephesto]]'s, except with many more stripes along with black suspenders. He also wears black pants and matching gloves. His hair is black but stringy, meaning it could be a different color if it was full. He had thick eyebrows during the first four seasons, but was later redesigned to have regular ones. He also seems to have bigger eyes than other children.\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Fosse McDonald}}\n\n==Personality==\nFosse is a bully, often laughing at things and people (in a similar matter as ''Beavis and Butthead''). In addition, he thinks everything is gay; on one occasion Fosse even said \"we're gay\", which shows he thinks everything is gay. Due to his seeming stupidity, it appears he did not advance to the fourth grade. He is never seen in the fourth grade classroom, but is in the halls, and is only seen in the hallway and playground after the second season. His voice appears to sound almost the same as [[Bill Allen]]'s. He was seen in \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\" when the boys discovered he, along with Bill, had stolen [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll. They then played along and were \"shot\" in the game; however, they were just playing a game and did not die. Fosse seems to be one of the more naive children in the school along with Bill, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Jason White|Jason]], and [[DogPoo Petuski|DogPoo]]. In the episode \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\", he is seen as part of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s group to help capture and lock up [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. It seems that unlike most other kids, ([[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Token Black|Token]], [[Jimmy Valmer]]) who are more aware of Cartman's manipulating methods, Fosse still has not wised up to it and so that is why Cartman would most likely seek him out for help.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Damien058.png|thumb|Bill and Fosse's fathers.]]\nDue to Fosse's quick phasing out from the series, his family was never officially seen. In the episode \"[[Damien]]\", [[Mr. Allen|two older]] [[Mr. McDonald|men]] are seen in the bar after [[Jesus]] storms out, saying \"This show's gay\" followed by \"Yeah, gay\" in the similar style to Bill and Fosse, while also having the same face and clothes but adult bodies. In the commentary of the episode it was revealed that these two characters were indeed Bill and Fosse's parents.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nFosse is a minor character in the game. He participates in the attack on [[South Park Elementary]] and Clyde's fortress alongside the player. He is seen being attacked by three elves, and he befriends the player after he saves them.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nFosse can be found with Bill at the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] bar. When interacted with, Fosse says, \"Sorry, you're not my type\" with regards to the player, Bill then responds with, \"Yeah, he's taken\", referring to Fosse. This could been seen as confirmation that Bill and Fosse are (somewhat ironically) in a relationship with one another; or it may simply be seen as the duo engaging in another example of their \"that's gay\" routine.\n\nThe New Kid can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Speedster|speedster]] ability.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - He and [[Bill Allen|Bill]] mock Stan's dog [[Sparky]] for being a homosexual.\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\"- He and Bill joins Terrance's group for the science fair.\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - Seen dressed as a Chewbacca.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - Participates in the Christmas play.\n*\"[[Damien]]\" - Blown away in the background by Damien's storm at the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\" - Plays the tuba in the school band.\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Passes [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]]'s note with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]] up to Stan.\n*\"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" - Watches [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] fight.\n*\"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\" - Seen in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]].\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]] ''\n*\"[[Chinpokomon]]\" - Seen at [[Luau's Toys]].\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" - Seen at the dance.\n*\"[[Timmy 2000]]\" - Seen in the audience for [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] and the Lords of the Underworld.\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - Seen as a candidate for as a new friend [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Eric Cartman]], but does not get picked.\n*\"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\" - Seen watching Cartman trying crap out his mouth.\n*\"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\" - He along with Bill are revealed to have stolen [[Sarah Peterson]]'s doll.\n*\"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\" - Seen at [[Whistlin' Willy's]].\n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" - Seen running out of the burning school.\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" - Seen playing football and also in the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins restaurant]].\n*\"[[The Jeffersons]]\" - Seen in [[Jefferson Residence]].\n*\"[[Douche and Turd]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Quest for Ratings]]\"\n*\"[[Best Friends Forever]]\"\n*\"[[The Losing Edge]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Smug Alert!]]\" - Seen at Cartman's party.\n*\"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[The List]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" - Seen watching Cartman and [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] fight.\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" - Seen as part of Cartman's group to capture and lock up Kyle.\n*\"[[Crème Fraiche]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\" - Seen checking the length of his penis.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Seen in the fitness class\n*\"[[Faith Hilling]]\" - Seen in the memeing class with the other [[The 4th Grade|4th Grade]] students.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in Stan's [[Make Bullying Kill Itself|anti-bullying video]].\n*\"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" - Seen in the background on the playground.\n*\"[[Going Native]]\" - Seen eating in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]\" - Seen eating in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Black Friday]]\" - Joins the PS4 army.\n*\"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]] - Seen as a member of the group that wants to get PS4s on Black Friday.\n*\"[[Titties and Dragons]]\" - Seen at [[Red Robin]].\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" - Seen at the student/parent/teacher assembly.\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - In the choir of children welcoming the Whole Foods inspector\n*\"[[Wieners Out]]\" - Seen in the school cafeteria.\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen making danishes in the school cafeteria.\n*\"[[SUPER HARD PCness]]\" - Seen in the gym after evacuation.\n*\"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Seen in quarantine with the other students.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Fosse was a part of Cartman's entourage to eliminate [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\". Although he does not speak, it is arguably his first major appearance since \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\".\n*Bill and Fosse are referred to by Matt and Trey within the scripts and commentaries as 'the Nerds', 'the Bullies' and the 'That's Gay Kids' - they actually rarely use the duo's real names.\n*Outside of \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" Fosse is never seen in the classroom seats at the same time as Bill - Bill is often there into the third season, and Fosse would occasionally reappear. Bill once appeared in 4th Grade Classroom B, but Fosse did not appear with him.\n*Fosse's original voice had a different pitch in the first season. In the second, third and seventh seasons, his voice is much deeper and sounds almost identical to Bill's. He also has a deep voice akin to Bill's in \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\", though in his preceding and immediate next appearances it is at its original pitch.\n*In \"[[T.M.I.]]\", his name is revealed on the chart as Fosse McDonald.\n*Fosse's hair looks similar to the ''Charlie Brown'' character Pig Pen's hair.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[it:Fosse McDonald]]\n[[ja:フォッシー・マクドナルド]]\n[[pl:Fosse McDonald]]\n[[zh:福西·麦克唐纳]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Supporting characters]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
