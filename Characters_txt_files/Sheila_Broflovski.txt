She is frequently despised and insulted by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who calls her a 'bitch' as she usually spoils his misguided fun. In fact, he has even created a song to make fun of her entitled \"[[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch]]\" and the central antagonist of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\n\n==Background==\n===Protests===\nUpon hearing of anything she finds offensive, Sheila exclaims \"What, what, what!\", and often starts something up about it. Cartman once noted this happens usually once a month, demanding to know why at the exact same time of the month, she always gets irritated by something, and he always ends up getting screwed by it. Her best-known protests are probably the ones connected to the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.\n\n====\"[[Death]]\"====\nShe lobbied with the other parents to have \"[[Terrance and Phillip]]\" taken off the network (much like the controversy and the protests against the TV show ''Beavis and Butthead'' who Terrance and Phillip are based on). Though it succeeded, she caused many lives to be lost when she had protesters take part in suicide attacks on the studio and a worse TV show was put on the air as a replacement. She was referred to as \"Carol\" in this episode along with [[Sharon Marsh]].\n\n====''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''====\nShe is offended by the influence [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s antics from their film ''Asses of Fire'' had on the children, so she created \"MAC\" or \"[[Mothers Against Canada]]\" since Terrance and Phillip are Canadian. She does this forgetting that her adopted son Ike is also Canadian.\n\nWhen Cartman [[Kyle's Mom's a Bitch|sings a song]] insulting her in protest, she has a V-Chip prototype installed in him to give off electric shocks whenever he swore.\n\nAlthough Sheila meant well in protesting the obscenity for the children's sake, it then lead to a war between [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\n====\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\"====\nShe was angered at the school nativity - particularly how Kyle was playing Joseph. She forced the play to adopt a non-offensive theme which everybody hated, ultimately provoking a riot in which she beat up [[Priest Maxi]] as he was restrained by Gerald.\n\n====\"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\"====\nShe was annoyed by the boys making fun of Nurse Gollum because she had the fictional disease \"conjoined twin myslexia\"(parasitic twin), so she taught them about the disease, but the boys started trying to split their heads open with ice picks to get supposed fetuses out (except Kyle and Kenny, who probably knew better). This resulted in an angry phone call from Sharon.\n\n====\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\"====\nA rare instance where her protest would actually help Kyle. She attempted to protest against Cartman for leading the whole school into believing her son was responsible for 9/11. However, this topic was brushed aside in favor of who defecated in the urinal at school, which happened to be Stan.\n\n====Minor Protests====\n*Sheila has been in protests against the Iraq War in \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" and various others.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:46a.jpg|thumb|Sheila on [[South Park Studios]].]]\nSheila wears a midnight blue dress suit with a white shirt and a violet-red skirt underneath. She also wears beige nylons, red lipstick, and gold earrings. Her hair is long and red, much like her son Kyle's, and put up in a beehive. She is overweight and shorter than average height. She speaks with a rather broad Jersey accent. In \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\", Sheila reveals that her family lived in Newark, New Jersey, that Gerald impregnated her with Kyle there, and that they moved to South Park two months later. In \"[[Margaritaville]]\", she wore a brown bedsheet in the form of a toga. For special occasions, her outfit is in black and dark grey colors.\n\nWhen she lived in Jersey, Sheila wore a yellow sleeve-less t-shirt that had \"S-Woww Titty Bang\" on it, a denim Jacket with the sleeves cut off, gray trousers, her hair in a curly ponytail, and black high heels.\n\nIn the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', her hair has faded with some gray highlights. She wears a red framed tinted glasses.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Sheila Broflovski}}\n\n==Personality==\nSheila is very protective about her family and has often led huge campaigns against beliefs and other such examples which she believes are unsafe, often going too far in her efforts and steamrolling her son in the process. She was the cause of the America-Canada War and was the leader behind \"Mothers Against Canada\" (M.A.C.). She also seems to be somewhat nosy, poking into things that are other people's business. For instance, when she found out that [[Gerald Broflovski]] and [[Stuart McCormick]] used to be friends in high school she arranged a fishing date between the two (which had bad results.) In retrospect, either the relationship between Gerald and Stuart OR the fact that the Broflovskis are from New Jersey may be non-canon, unless Stuart McCormick lived in New Jersey with Gerald prior, or Gerald and Stuart went to high school together in South Park or some other location, before Gerald moved to New Jersey and impregnated Sheila with Kyle.\n\nShe is also quite quick to anger when she is challenged, or more correctly when someone tries to tell her she is wrong. An example being that she shot Terrance and Phillip when Kyle told her she was wrong in starting a war with Canada when all he did was go see an R rated movie, in normal episodes when Kyle tries to talk back Sheila raises her voice and gives him into trouble no matter how right he might be to do so.\n\nIn the 8th draft of the script for the movie, it is clear that the power of leading M.A.C. went to her head and made her insane to the point where after discovering Ike, Cartman, and Kyle were at the USO show, General Plymkin thinks they are \"Canadian Sympathizers\" and wanted them executed alongside Terrance and Phillip and apparently she and Cartman's mom were okay with it while Stan and Kenny's mothers were shocked at this act.\n\nAfter the war began she went on an insane rant about how perfect her plan is to eliminate \"not pretty things\" and among other things admitted that Kyle was not born in a hospital. That and she mistook Satan for Alan Dershowitz. This aspect of Sheila's was dropped from the main film as it seemed to be very uncharacteristic of her and to make her more sympathetic as she saw what the war lead to.\n\nHowever, her over-protective and annoying personality and protests seem to have diminished a lot in recent seasons. The protests could reveal a vulnerability in Sheila in that she may have a fear of people's perception of her as a mother. She also wants to shift blame as seen in \"[[Death]]\", where she wants to protect the children or in the movie, where in one of her songs, \"[[Blame Canada]]\", she states at the end of the song: \"''We must blame them and cause a fuss/Before somebody thinks of blaming us!\"''\n\nKyle even says that whenever he gets in trouble, instead of holding him responsible, Sheila looks for someone else to blame.\n\n==Criminal Record==\n*'''Arson:''' In \"[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]\", she burns down 2 stores: Wall-Mart and Jim's Drugs.\n*'''Murder: '''In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', she murders Terrance and Phillip, although these deaths are reversed due to Kenny's sacrifice and Cartman's V-Chip malfunctioning.\n*'''Medical terrorism: '''After Shelly comes down with chicken pox, she and the other parents expose their kids to a chicken pox-infected Kenny, since getting the disease at an older age can be deadly. Kyle later confronts his mother about this.\n\n==Family==\nHer first name, and red hair, suggest that she is of Irish or Scottish descent. However, red hair is also common in Jewish heritage. This coincides with the fact that she, and not Kyle's father, is the more stereotypical Jew in the family. It is also possible that her maiden name is Schwartz, since Kyle Schwartz is her nephew.  \n\n===Similarities and Differences to Matt Stone's Family===\nSheila is named after Matt Stone's own mother, and Kyle's family surname is derived from Stone's mother's original maiden name, Broslovski (which was changed to \"Belasco\" when her ancestors immigrated to the United States). This may explain why the family's name was spelled in various ways early on in the series (e.g., Brosloski, Brovlofski, etc.).\n\nEven though the entire Broflovski family practices Judaism on the show, in real life, Matt Stone's mother is the only Jew in the family (and he has mentioned that he and his sister, Rachel, were brought up agnostic). His sister is the only member of his family who is not represented on the show. This could possibly be because Stan (and in real life, Trey Parker) \nhas a sister and with Matt and Trey considering themselves very similar anyway, for both Kyle and Stan to have a sister would make them far too similar.\n\nStone claims to have learned phrases and pet names like \"bubbe\" from his maternal grandparents, who like their daughter, were Jewish.\n\n===Gerald Broflovski===\n{{Main|Gerald Broflovski}}\nHe is Sheila's husband and the town of South Park's most prominent lawyer. The pair met while in College, and apparently it was Sheila's decision for them to move back to Gerald's hometown of South Park to raise their family. The pair of them seem to have a strong marriage, and aside from a period of Gerald having erectile dysfunction, have never appeared to have any obvious marital problems. However, in \"Chef Aid\" she cheated on Gerald with Chef and Gerald strangely accepts this adulterous affair. Gerald seems to accept his wife's hard character activism, and often supports her, such as the events of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. The pair have one natural born child, Kyle, and either due to the inability to have another or simply a personal decision, adopted Ike. Their sex life is a bit unusual, usually involving roleplay or kinks (which one or both of their sons were unfortunately scarred by).\n\n===Kyle Broflovski===\n{{Main|Kyle Broflovski}}\nHe is her oldest son and also one of the main characters. Sheila has unquestionable love for Kyle, who loves equally as much and often defends her a lot, particularly from his friend/foe [[Eric Cartman]]. However, even Kyle finds her personality hard to bear at times, as the things she does for him can often cause him grief and social stigmata, such as protesting [[Terrance and Phillip]]. As the series has progressed however, Sheila's activism has lessened, making Kyle's relationship with his mother easier to deal with.\n\n===Ike Broflovski===\n{{Main|Ike Broflovski}}\nHe is Sheila's youngest son from Canada. It is clear that Sheila loves him as much as her biological son Kyle, and she often even seems to forget that he is adopted. The reason for adopting Ike is never clear, but its possible that Sheila was incapable of bearing another child after Kyle—possibly the reason that Kyle gets sick so often. Sheila seems to become upset with Ike when he breaks a window after Kyle plays \"Kick the Baby\" with him.\n\n===Kyle Schwartz===\n{{Main|Kyle Schwartz}}\nHe is Sheila's nephew. She welcomed him with open arms during his visit to South Park, and even, to make him feel a little more comfortable, promised to address him as \"Kyle\", and her own son as \"Kyle 2\".\n\n===Cleo Broflovski===\n{{Main|Cleo Broflovski}}\nShe is Sheila's deceased mother, who was never seen alive on-screen. She apparently had the surname \"Broflovski\", as this was the name on her gravestone in the episode \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\". While this is most likely just a mistake, it seems to imply that she and Gerald had the same surname before they were married, which in turn could indicate that they were related and committed incest. Of course, it could also mean that Gerald chose to go by Sheila's name after marriage, instead of the other way around.\n\n===Sister===\nSheila mentioned in \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\" that she had a sister to [[Barbra Streisand]] by asking for an autograph claiming \"her sister would die\". This mysterious sister of Sheila's, however, is unnamed and has not made any known appearances.\n\n==Video Games==\n====''[[South Park: Chef's Luv Shack]]''====\nSheila makes a brief appearance in the minigame called ''Avalanche''.\n\n====''[[South Park Rally]]''====\nSheila appears in South Park Rally as unlockable character. But, Like [[Scuzzlebutt]] and [[Liane Cartman|Liane]], Sheila is not available for Nintendo 64. In Easter Egg Hunt Race, You have to catch the Pot Pie (Golden Cow in PlayStation Version), Located near the [[Hells Pass Hospital]].\n\n====''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''====\nSheila Broflovski appears in the game as a minor character, remaining inside the [[Community Center]] during the entire game.\n\n====''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''====\nSheila can be found at her home in the game. She plays a role as a boss in the mission \"[[Alternate Universes Collide Again]]\" when [[Kyle Schwartz]] calls her after being beaten up by The New Kid. She comes out furiously and decides to attack The New Kid and his selected allies. She can be taken a selfie with after The New Kid successful wins the match. She can also be seen at [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] eating with her family in the expansion pack ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'' and can be selfied with without requirement.\n{{TFBW Enemy Abilities\n|Name = Sheila Broflovski\n|Image = Tb kylesmom.png\n|Health = 300\n|Move = 1\n|Immunities = None\n|AbilityImage1 = Sheila_power1.png\n|Ability1 = Psycho Slaps\n|Description1 = Slaps a superhero five times.\n|RangeDesc1 = One tile in front of Sheila\n|Range1 = Melee.png\n|Effect1 = 34 Damage (Cas.)<br>68 Damage (Hero.)<br>85 Damage (Mast.)<br>119 Damage (Dia.)\n|Status1 = None\n|AbilityImage2 = Sheila_power2.png\n|Ability2 = Jersey Slide\n|Description2 = Charges towards a superhero.\n|RangeDesc2 = Closest target within three tiles in front of Sheila.

She has had a speaking role in every season to date, as well as a major role in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' and a minor appearance in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Although she did not physically appear, she was briefly mentioned by Kyle, saying that she would not allow him to keep his pet elephant in the house.\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Her first appearance.
