He served as a Congressman, for Pennsylvania, and served a second term for Delaware.\n\n==Background==\nWhile in his self-induced flashback to 1776, Eric Cartman meets the Continental Congress and sees them argue and insult each other in a similar way the adults of his time do. John Dickinson is against the war of independence and wants to use peaceful diplomacy. [[John Adams]] believes war is inevitable and is the only way to be free from England and become a sovereign nation.\n\n==Appearance==\nJohn Dickinson is dressed in the typical clothes of the 18th century, with a gray wig, red waistcoat, black outer coat. His animated persona was stylistically more realistic than the normal round type used regularly.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want!\"\n*\"But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.\"\n*\"We cannot found a country based on war! Right.\"\n*\"If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{HistoricalCelebrities}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n[[zh:约翰·迪金森]]\n[[Category:Historical celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Kyle McCulloch]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]"
