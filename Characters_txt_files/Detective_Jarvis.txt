He says that he wants to collect testimony from the children, but only shows how a pedophile would treat them.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has brown hair, which he combs back, and wears a black suit with a dark red tie and a yellow badge.\n\nHis character model was reused with modified coloration, no badge, and a more youthful face, as weatherman [[Keenan Williams]] in \"[[Smug Alert!]]\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Detective Jarvis\">\nTheReturnofChef036.png|Detective Jarvis questioning [[The 4th Grade]] class about Chef's behavior in \"[[The Return of Chef]]\".\nDetectiveJarvisOooh.png|Jarvis seen getting excessive in his demonstrations.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe seems to take his demonstrations very seriously, demonstrating the actions of pedophiles with unusual enthusiasm. He also seems very childish when convinced of something, as shown from his responses to [[Stan Marsh]] refusing that Chef is a pedophile.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n[[fr:Detective Jarvis]]\n[[pl:Detectyw Jarvis]]\n[[zh:贾维斯警探]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]"
