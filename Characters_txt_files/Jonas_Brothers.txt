They appear in \"[[The Ring]]\" and made a brief cameo in \"[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===\"[[The List]]\"===\nA poster of Joe Jonas is seen hung on the wall of the girls' Pleases & Sparkles club.\n\n===\"[[The Ring]]\"===\nIn an attempt to lure her into a sexual relationship, [[Kenny McCormick]] takes his new girlfriend, [[Tammy Warner]] to a Jonas Brothers concert, after discovering that they apparently cause her to become sexually aroused. After the concert, the Jonas Brothers invite several girls into their dressing room, where the girls assume they're there to give the boys blow jobs. The boys have no idea what blowjobs are, and instead, preach to the girls about their religious faith, and then give the girls [[Purity Ring|purity rings]] in an attempt to encourage them to not engage in any sort of \"naughty\" behavior such as sex, drugs, watching \"naughty TV shows\", or swearing.\n\nWhile the boys are successful at doing this, it is revealed that the Brothers dislike the idea of forcing the rings on the girls, wanting their careers to be about their music. [[Mickey Mouse]], their boss and the owner of the Disney Corporation, forces them to promote the rings, as he wants to sell sex to little girls, but without parents realizing it. When the Brothers try to back out of their deal with Disney, Mickey Mouse proceeds to beat the lead singer to keep them in line. After [[The Boys|the boys]] reveal the truth behind Mickey's plan, the Jonas Brothers were freed from his control.\n\n===\"[[Funnybot]]\"===\nIn the film featuring [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]] having sex with two girls, two posters, one featuring headshots of the three brothers and another promoting ''Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience'', can be seen on the bedroom wall.\n\n===\"[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]\"===\nThe Jonas Brothers made a brief cameo in a music video that [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] was watching until [[Stephen Stotch|his father]] changed the station to something \"educational\".\n\n===\"[[Member Berries]]\"===\n[[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner]] are briefly shown dancing to \"[[Cake by the Ocean]]\", a song by Joe Jonas's band DNCE.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey're all similar, having similar facial features.\n===Kevin Jonas===\nKevin wears a black vest, white \"dress\" shirt, a pink undershirt, tan pants, and black \"dress\" shoes.\n\n===Joe Jonas===\nJoe wears a red \"dress\" shirt, a gray tie, black pants, and white sneakers.\n\n===Nick Jonas===\nNick wears a tan coat, a light blue and yellow shirt, dark gray pants, and black and white, gray trimmed sneakers.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Jonas Brothers\">\nJB (7).png|The Jonas Brothers performing.\nJB (8).png|The Jonas Brothers talking to a group of fans.\nJB (9).png|Kenny watching the Jonas Brothers talk to a group of fans, including his girlfriend, [[Tammy Warner]].\nJB (1).png|''\"Well, we don't want to sell sex to little girls anymore.\"''\nJB (2).png|''\"You don't fucking talk to me like that!\"''\nJB (3).png|''\"Do we have a problem?\"'', ''\"No Mr. Mouse...\"'', ''\"Oh good, I thought we had a problem.\"''\nJB (4).png|The Jonas Brothers dousing their fans with white foam.\nJB (5).png|Another shot of the Jonas Brothers dousing their fans with white foam.\nJB (6).png|[[Mickey Mouse]] threatening the Jonas Brothers.\nJB (10).png|The Jonas Brothers in their music video.\nJB (11).png|''\"Now, I hear we're having problems?\"''\nFunnybot_-_Jonas_Brothers.png|Two posters featuring the Jonas Brothers\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nThey all have similar personalities, having good moral centers as well as being compassionate about their music, to such an extent that they challenged [[Mickey Mouse]]'s, even though they knew they would get in trouble.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Thirteen}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n[[ja:ジョナス・ブラザーズ]]\n[[zh:乔纳斯兄弟]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
