It was said to perform at the \"''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]\"'', but was only seen in the opening.\n\n===Real===\nThe real Robin Williams was a huge fan of South Park. He performed Stone and Parker's song [[Blame Canada]] at the 1999 Oscars. Ironically, the original choice to sing it, [[Mary Kay Bergman]], the female's voice actress fell into a depression and committed suicide just like Robin.\n\n==Appearance==\nWhen Robin appeared as a hologram, he wore reindeer antlers and a red Rudolph nose, which may be a reference to ''Patch Adams''.\n\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eighteen}}\n[[es:Holograma de Robin Williams]]\n[[pl:Robin Williams Hologram]]\n[[zh:罗宾·威廉姆斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
