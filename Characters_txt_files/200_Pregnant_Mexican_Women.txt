The PC bros would continue to be further distracted by a flood of [[Syrian Refugee Children]], who would then be chased by [[Jared Fogle]], who is intent on molesting them.\n\n==Appearance==\nAll of the women have varying appearances. However, they are all Hispanic and are very visibly pregnant. Some of the women are seen wearing maternity dresses and skirts, while some wear active pants and maternity shirts.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n[[ja:200人のメキシコ人妊婦]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]"
