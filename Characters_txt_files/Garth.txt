He was killed by [[Moses]] for worshiping [[Haman]].\n\n==Background==\nHe represented the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism at Jewbilee, which worshiped [[Haman]] instead of Moses. He captures [[Moses]] in a conch shell and attempts to bring Haman to power, but ultimately fails. He is killed by Moses at the end of the episode.\n\n==Appearance==\nGarth has curly brown hair and a wrinkled forehead. He dresses similarly to the other Elders at Jewbilee, wearing a grey-green kippah and robes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Garth\">\n309 Jewbilee00017.jpg|Garth at Jewbilee.\n309 Jewbilee00023.jpg|Garth captures Moses in a conch shell.\n309 Jewbilee00032.jpg|Garth kicks Kenny.\n309 Jewbilee00035.jpg|Garth is killed by Moses.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nGarth is a mean-spirited and treacherous character. He infiltrates Jewbilee with the intention of capturing Moses in a conch shell, betraying the trust of the other Elders. He looks forward to Haman's ascent to power, even though he knows that the rest of the Jews will die.\n\nGarth is also a coward. When [[Kenny McCormick]] releases Moses from the conch shell, Garth acts as if the whole thing had been a joke.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nGarth appears to have limited mystical powers, as he is able to capture Moses in a conch shell by reading from the Book of Haman. He also summons the spirit of Haman by reading from this book, causing lightning to strike and Haman's face to appear in the sky.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Moses]]===\nGarth captures Moses in a conch shell. When Moses is later freed, he kills Garth by zapping him with rays.\n\n===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===\nGarth locks up Kyle, along with the rest of the Jew scouts and elders at Jewbilee, in a cabin while he summons Haman.\n\n===[[Kenny McCormick]]===\nKenny breaks open the conch containing Moses. This ends Garth's attempt to bring Haman to power, and Moses kills him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Garth was a member of the synagogue of anti-Semites. An anti-Semite is a person prejudiced against Jews.\n*Haman is a character described in the [[Wikipedia:Haman (Bible)|Book of Esther]] as an antagonist who tried to convince the King of Persia to destroy all of the Jews in the land but was instead hanged for treason at the request of the Queen, whom the book is named after.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[zh:加斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Anti-Semitic characters]]"
