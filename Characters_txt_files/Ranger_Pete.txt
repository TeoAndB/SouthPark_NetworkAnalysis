"{{South Park character\n|name = Ranger Pete\n|image = Civil-servants-ranger-pete.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Brown\n|job = Forest Ranger\n|appearance = \"[[Insheeption]]\"\n}}\n'''Ranger Pete''' was a forest ranger who appears in [[Season Fourteen]] episode \"[[Insheeption]]\", speaking to the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s class the day they went on a field trip to [[Frisco Woods]]. He introduced them to [[Woodsy Owl]], not suspecting that Woodsy was a child molester, and paired Mackey up with [[Billy Thompson]] and his friends, unknowingly setting in motion the events leading to the young Mackey's molestation by Woodsy Owl.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears the standard forest ranger uniform: a light brown hat, a light brown shirt with several metals and patches, and brown pants. He also wears a belt with keys attached to it.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Ranger Pete\">\nRangerPete.png|''But first we have a very special guest...It's [[Woodsy Owl]]!\"''\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe seems to love the forest, which fits in perfectly with his job. He may also be slightly unintelligent, failing to see the young [[Mr. Mackey]]'s fear when [[Billy Thompson]] wants to be in Mackey's group.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]"
