When they first arrive, they go to the Costa Rican Capitol building and meet the president. He does not understand English when [[Ms. Stevens]] tries to communicate with him. The group has to wait for [[Mr. Mackey]] to arrive, who speaks to him in Spanish. The choir performs their [[Getting Gay With Kids (Song)|song and dance routine]] outside the Capitol Building. The President then sends the choir on a tour of the rainforest headed by the tour guide [[Pablo]].\n\nAfter Pablo gets eaten by a snake, the choir group gets lost in the rainforest. The next day, the day of the summit, Mr. Mackey and the President both discover that the choir group never returned to the hotel. They become pretty concerned and Mr. Mackey reassures the President that the choir will show up in time. When there is still no sign of the group an hour before the concert starts, the President stalls time by telling Polack jokes. Thankfully, the group makes it back just in time. Having had a terrible experience in the rainforest, they change the lyrics of their song. The new version rebukes the rainforest and is considered inspiring by some audience members.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Costa Rican President has black balding hair combed to one side, a visible nose and eyebrows, and a curly mustache. He is visibly overweight. He wears a yellow shirt with two chest pockets and a gray stain, a black-tie sloppily draped around his neck, black pants, and black shoes.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\"\n*\"[[Probably]]\" - Seen in hell when [[Satan]] and [[Chris]] reunite.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The actual Costa Rican President at the time of the episode was Miguel Ángel Rodríguez.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[fr:Costa Rican President]]\n[[zh:哥斯达黎加总统]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]"
