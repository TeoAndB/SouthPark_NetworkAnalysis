He was the gang's computer expert. He did not trust [[Franz]] with the loot as he presumed he would flee with it and would never see him again and so demanded his cut early, which was only what seemed to be a measly Burger King kid's meal and three dollar bills. When the police stormed [[Pioneer Village]], Orlich was the first of the thieves to get shot and killed in the ensuing firefight.\n\n==Appearance==\nOrlich has short, blond hair. He wears a black shirt, what appears to be a bulletproof vest, and gray pants.
