However, shortly thereafter, Cartman finds him in pot of boiling of water. Marc was apparently killed by another toy of Cartman's, Polly Prissypants, who was, in reality, a manifestation of Cartman's twisted subconscious.\n\n==Appearance==\nMarc has short black hair, is topless, wears a pair of brown pants and black shoes with white laces. His name is written on his belt buckle. He is shown to be muscular, small, and covered in what appear to be stickers in the likeness of tattoos. The stickers are in the shape of stars and Cartman's other toys Clyde Frog and Rumpertumskin. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Muscleman Marc\">\nMuscle_Man_Mark.jpg|Muscleman Marc at [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] tea party.\nOnePercentPromo2.jpg|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] cries to his toys including Muscleman Marc in \"[[1%]]\".\nMuscleMan Marc Boiled Alive.png|Muscleman Marc boiled alive in \"[[1%]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Muscleman Marc is modeled after fashion clothes designer and business entrepreneur [[Wikipedia:Marc Jacobs|Marc Jacobs]]. He was added to Cartman's toy collection as an homage to Jacobs after series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] learned he had tattoos of Clyde Frog and Rumpertumskin.\n__NOWYSIWYG__\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[zh:肌肉男马克]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Toys]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
