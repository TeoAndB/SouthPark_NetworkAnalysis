He is generally used as a background character. He is best known for his lines \"Hey, hold on a second ... These are like the hottest tits I've ever seen!\" and \"Hey, hold on a second! Bewbs!\" in the episode \"[[Pre-School]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe is first seen in the episode \"[[Fourth Grade]]\", where he, along with [[Bartles]] and another unnamed 6th grader, bullies [[The Boys|the boys]]. He was in 5th grade in this episode.\n\nHe later played a speaking role in \"[[Pre-School]]\", where he, along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]], vows to defend the boys from [[Trent Boyett]] in exchange for a photo of [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s [[Sharon Marsh|mom]]'s boobs, but end up losing to Trent.\n\nIn \"[[About Last Night...]]\" he is seen again with Bartles and another unnamed 6th Grader firing fireworks.\n\n==Personality==\nLike most 6th graders, he is a bully and likes to torment kids younger than him, like 4th graders. Like the other 6th graders, he is not very smart, as he really believed that the photo the boys brought was really a photo of [[Sharon Marsh]]'s breasts. He probably stopped being a bully after \"[[Pre-School]]\", as he participated in [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s anti-bullying video.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Bartles]] and the [[6th Grader with Green Shirt]]===\nHe was seen alongside these two 6th Graders in a few episodes. In the episode \"[[Fourth Grade]]\" the three are seen pushing [[The Boys|the boys]] together and in the episode \"[[About Last Night...]]\" they are seen firing fireworks. The three are also seen at the end of the episode \"[[Pre-School]]\", but with the [[6th Grader Leader]] together.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has black hair similar to [[Stan Marsh]] and wears a short-sleeved blue shirt with two bright blue stripes on the right side, cyan pants and black shoes.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the 6th Grader with Black Hair and Blue Shirt\" widths=\"158\">\n411 00002.jpg|The 6th Grader with Black Hair with his two friends talking to [[The Boys]].\nPreSchool30.png|The 6th Grader with Black Hair talking to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]].\nPreSchool44.png|The 6th Grader with Black Hair seeing a fake picture of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s boobs.\nPreSchool47.png|The 6th Grader with Black Hair talking to another 6th grader.\nSPEPITEST - 00128.png|Seen on the left side.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Fourth Grade]]\" - Debut\n*\"[[Cripple Fight]]\" - Seen as one of the Boy Scouts.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Seen watching [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s video.\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - (Cameo)\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" - He and the other 6th graders want to take a porn tape that the boys were carrying.
