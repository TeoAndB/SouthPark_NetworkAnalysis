She appears in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\". She was not seen at her [[Mabel Cartman|daughter's]] funeral in \"[[Cartmanland]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nDuring her first appearance, she is shown as an overweight old lady with a very wrinkly face and a green dress. Due to her weight and age, she is usually seen with a walker to help her move. It is also presumed that she suffers from urinary incontinence as she has to have a catheter bag with her at all times.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Florence Cartman\">\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson27.png|Florence in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nLike Cartman, she is shown to have quite a temper. This can be seen when her daughter asks her to \"do the honors\" of saying grace which causes her to respond quite aggressively, as she feels she always does it.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cartman Family}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n\n[[es:Florencia Cartman]]\n[[pl:Florence Cartman]]\n[[ru:Флоренс Картман]]\n[[zh:弗罗伦斯·卡特曼]]\n[[Category:Cartman/Tenorman family]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]"
