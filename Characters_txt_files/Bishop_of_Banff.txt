"{{South Park character\n|name = Bishop of Banff\n|image = Bishop-of-banff.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Gray\n|job = Bishop\n|appearance = \"[[Royal Pudding]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Bishop of Banff''' first appeared in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", where he was seen at the Canadian royal wedding.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", the Bishop of Banff appears as one of the attendees of the Canadian royal wedding between the [[Prince and Princess of Canada]]. He leads the Prince to the front of the church to the vat of butterscotch pudding. In this episode, he is referred to as the Bishop of Newfoundland.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\nThe Bishop of Banff plays a more significant role in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''. In the game, it is revealed by the Prince of Canada that the Bishop of Banff had tried to let Montreal back into the kingdom. Believing that the Bishop was doing this just to make his life more difficult, the Prince asks [[The New Kid]] to go to Banff and kill the Bishop. He also asks The New Kid to bring the Bishop's balls as proof that he killed him. When The New Kids gets to Banff, he can hit the Bishop to initiate a fight against him. After The New Kid defeats the Bishop, he can either choose to spare him or kill him. If he kills him, he gets his balls to take back to the Prince. If he spares the Bishop, he will get a pair of dire pig testicles and will receive a friend request from the Bishop.\n\n===Special Attacks===\n*'''Judge the Philistine''' - The bishop farts on the target inflicting grossed out damage if not blocked.\n*'''Communion''' - The bishop heals himself and removes debuffs.\n*'''Cleanse the Wicked''' - The bishop summons a bunch of spirits from the dead. This attack is very weak but will remove all buffs if not blocked.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Bishop of Banff has short gray hair, a gray mustache, and a gray goatee. He wears a tall yellow hat, a large yellow robe over another white robe, black shoes, and a pair of glasses. He is very overweight.\n\n==Trivia==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\n*Sparing the Bishop is recommended if the player is trying to achieve the \"More Popular than John Lennon\" [[South Park: The Stick of Truth/Achievements|achievement/trophy]], as he is the only friend who can die. If the New Kid kills the Bishop however, getting the achievement will be impossible, and The New Kid's amount of friends will stop at 119.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[es:Obispo de Banff]]\n[[fr:Bishop of Banff]]\n[[zh:班夫主教]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]\n[[Category:Religious Figures]]"
