Whenever a question is being asked, the kids could only reply with an \"I don't know.\"\n\nSome of the house rules which the kids have to follow include:\n*Be uncertain if God exists (per the family's agnostic code)\n*Drinking \"agnostic\" beverages only, particularly [[Dr. Pep-er]], as no one is sure what flavor it is\n*Not making furniture too clean\n\nWhen one of the kids, [[David Weatherhead]] claims that he saw an [[Mysterion|angel]], he is taken to [[the Punishment Room]] where he is sprayed with Dr. Pep-er, with the other kids watching. The room was eventually discovered by Mr. Adams, who then breaks down upon seeing what had happened.\n\nThe Weatherheads are later arrested after drinking a can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] which Mysterion had left for them. The Weatherhead kids are also returned to their respective families.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:韦瑟赫德家的孩子]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
