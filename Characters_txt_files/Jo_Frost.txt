She appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, \"[[Tsst]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Tsst]]\", after [[Stella Reid]] failed to cure [[Eric Cartman]], [[Liane Cartman]] hired Nanny Frost to help her control her son [[Eric Cartman|Eric]]'s behavior. She was initially confident, declaring, \"There's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time, you're going to see a new Eric Cartman!\" but she too failed.\n\nThree days hence, Frost was institutionalized at Slater-Carey Mental Hospital, where she now spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. Between mouthfuls of defecate, she screams that Cartman comes from [[hell]].\n\n==Appearance==\nShe appears in a purple cardigan and dress and wears rectangular glasses. She appears slightly overweight and has a mole on her left cheek. She is also at one point seen with a parasol patterned with the colors of the Union Jack. Like many British characters, she is shown to have bad teeth.\n\nAfter being institutionalized, she is seen in a white mental patient's uniform, with messed up hair and covered in her own feces.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Jo Frost\">\nTsst (45).png|Jo Frost against a background of video clips of her at work with numerous badly behaved kids.\nTsst (46).png|\"''Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through!''\"\nTsst (51).png|Jo Frost after being institutionalized and defeated by Cartman.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the opening title sequence to ''Supernanny'', Frost is seen with numerous [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] children, including [[Heidi Turner]], [[Millie Larsen]], [[Pete Thelman]], and [[Damien Thorn|Damien]]. This makes sense considering the fact that all the children in South Park have a criminal record and receive extremely lenient punishments.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[zh:乔·弗罗斯特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by April Stewart]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
