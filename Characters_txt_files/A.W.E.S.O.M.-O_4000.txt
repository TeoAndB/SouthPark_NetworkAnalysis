Butters said if Cartman pranks him again he would show everyone an embarrassing video of him pretending to be [[Britney Spears]] while dancing with a [[Justin Timberlake]] cardboard cutout.\n\nCartman, therefore, went to all lengths to protect his identity, even going to [[Los Angeles]] to visit Butters' [[Nellie Stotch|aunt]] with Butters. A.W.E.S.O.M.-O excused himself to the bathroom, where he took off his mask and proceeded to wipe his sweaty face and eat toothpaste because Butters would not leave his side and said that robots do not need to eat. Eventually, movie producers took A.W.E.S.O.M.-O and made him come up with films.\n\nCartman, as A.W.E.S.O.M.-O, came up with 2,884 films (over 800 of which star [[Adam Sandler]]). The military then kidnapped him, trying to use him as a weapon, but the scientist protected him. Butters comes in at an attempt to save his robot because he considered A.W.E.S.O.M.-O his best friend. The military felt sympathy for Butters and A.W.E.S.O.M.-O at the last moment, which Cartman ruined by farting. He tried to cover it up by saying its a \"sequence\" because Butters knew that robots are not supposed to fart and got suspicious. Butters lifts up the mask and carries out his promise of showing the video of Cartman dressed as Britney Spears to the whole class.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000\">\nAWO4.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O gets out of the crate.\nAWO9.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O and Butters walking on the fields.\nAWO15.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O inserting medicinal suppository in Butters' anus.\nAWO16.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O sleeps with Butters.\nAWO22.png|Cartman speaking to the boys.\nAWO31.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O applies sunscreen on Butters' back.\nAWO41.png|A.W.E.S.O.M.-O is kidnapped by the military.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The name A.W.E.S.O.M-O might be a reference to [[Wikipedia:Asimo|Asimo]], one of the most advanced Japanese androids.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eight}}\n[[es:GENIAL-O 4000]]\n[[fr:A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]]\n[[zh:超赞哦机器人（角色）]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Objects]]"
