The [[Fonics Monkey]] also joined them on drums.\n\n==Background==\nDio was a Heavy Metal/Hard Rock band led by Ronnie James Dio. They are described as a musical force of the '70s and '80s by [[Principal Victoria]].\n\nIn a 2002 interview for Reality Check TV, when asked about his parodied appearance in ''[[South Park]]'', Ronnie James described it as being \"wonderful\". He commented that he initially did not want to let it be done because he felt that they were just going to \"crucify\" him, although the producers ended up convincing him that they were fans of his music and that he would like it, so he ultimately accepted.\n\nHe showed some reservations about how they portrayed his talking voice, though (which in the episode, following the usual ''South Park'' trend, is comically high-pitched). When asked if the producers had approached him to lend his own voice for his animated version, he responded that they did not do so and that he would not have done it, anyway. He then confirmed that they had indeed obtained the rights to play their hit song \"[[Holy Diver]]\" in the episode.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75TCYuq0-Lw&t=7m20s \"Ronnie James Dio on Reality Check TV (2002)\".] YouTube.
