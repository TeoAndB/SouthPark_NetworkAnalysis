In the United States, Cuban Exiles joyfully celebrated his death.\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] asks his parents for permission to go to a Raging Pussies concert, they reply he may go if he can manage to complete three tasks, one of which includes bringing democracy to Cuba. Kyle sends Fidel a drawing of him crying and holding a flower and asks if Cuba could change. The letter was appealing to Castro so he decides to accept Kyle's request and ends communism in Cuba. This became very shocking for Kyle's parents since they thought the task they gave him was impossible enough to disallow Kyle from attending the concert. \n\n==Appearance==\nCastro has gray hair, dark gray eyebrows, and a long gray beard.
