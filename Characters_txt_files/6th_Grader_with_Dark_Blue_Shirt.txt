He is usually used as a background character.\n\n==Background==\nFor now, the only episode in which he has a speaking role is in \"[[Pre-School]]\". In this episode he along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] promise to defend [[The Boys]] from [[Trent Boyett]] in exchange for a picture of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s boobs. After the boys gave the picture (which was actually a picture of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ass), the 6th graders try to fight Trent but fail.\n\n==Personality==\nNot much is known about his personality. We can assume that he behaves the same as the other 6th graders, like spending time bullying children younger than him.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has curly brown hair and wears a dark blue shirt with orange collar, light brown pants and black shoes.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the 6th Grader with Dark Blue Shirt\" widths=\"170\">\nPreSchool45.png|He along with other 6th Graders seeing a fake picture of Stan's mom's boobs.\nSPEPITEST - 00128.png|Seen on the right side\nSPTFS41.png|Seen on the right side.\n6thGraderDarkBlueShirtEscape.png| He is seen as one of many students of South Park Elementary escaping school\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Pre-School]]\"\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\"\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\"\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of [[Heidi Turner|Heidi's]] bedroom.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of Heidi's bedroom.\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\"\n*\"[[Tegridy Farms Halloween Special]]\"\n*\"[[Board Girls]]\"\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Seen escaping school with the other kids.\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:深蓝色衬衫六年级生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:6th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
