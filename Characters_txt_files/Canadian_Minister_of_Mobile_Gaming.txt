He is eventually revealed to be the Canadian Devil, Beelzeboot, and is defeated by [[Satan]]. Satan also mentions that it's not the first time Beelzeboot creates a no-brainer temptation without any sense of nuance, and there has been a struggle between them for ages because of that.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Canadian Devil.png|thumb|left|The Canadian Devil.]]\nThe Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming, like the other Canadians, has beady eyes and a Pac-Man-like head that flaps up and down. He is balding, has brown hair and a brown mustache, and wears a gray suit with a black tie. He initially speaks with a French-Canadian accent, later switching to a normal accent before revealing his true self.\n\nAs the Canadian Devil, he resembles a smaller, Canadian version of Satan. He has red skin and dark red demon wings, his brown hair and mustache has turned black, has a black loincloth, and he has small horns atop his head and one fang in his mouth. He also carries a red pitchfork, and occasionally farts fireballs. \n\n<gallery widths=\"120\" caption=\"Images of the Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming\">\nCMMG.jpg|The Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming\n1806_LiveTweet_Pic19_CanadianDevil.jpg|Concept art for the Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming\nconversion_rate_freemium.png|The Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming explaining about freemium games\nsouth-park-s18e06c11-built-an-addiction-machine_16x9.jpg|\nsouth-park-s18e06c13-beelzaboot_16x9.jpg|The Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming as the Canadian Devil\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eighteen}}\n[[es:Beelzaboot]]\n[[fr:Canadian Minister of Mobile Gaming]]\n[[zh:比欧扎布]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
