He appears in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\". He was also featured prominently in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, \"[[Obama Wins!]]\". Along with [[Brian Boitano]], he is also known on ''[[South Park]]'' for being one of the few celebrities to be mimicked in a positive way. Most celebrities are portrayed as stupid or spoiled.\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Butters Stotch]] takes credit for writing a horrifically vulgar and disgusting book, entitled ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]'', written in truth by [[The Boys|the boys]], he becomes a world-wide beloved author. Butters then decides to write a [[The Poop That Took a Pee|sequel book]], in which he claims it will be as raunchy as the first.\n[[file:The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (61).png|thumb|left|Morgan Freeman reading from ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]''.]]\nWhen the book is at last released, the [[Today Show]] does a segment in which they have Morgan Freeman read five chapters from the book. Unfortunately, the book is nowhere near as vulgar as the original, instead coming off as childishly written, and resulting in Freeman essentially repeating the words \"poop\" and \"pee\" in assorted manners.\n\nIn \"[[Obama Wins!]]\", Freeman appears when information about the current setting needs to be explained. He first appears at [[Red Lobster]] explaining the significance of the ''Star Wars'' franchise to the [[United States]] government. He also explains the relationship between [[General Tso]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Eric Cartman]], and the debacle regarding the missing election ballots.  When asked why he always shows up to explain complicated situations, he responds that every time he explains something, he earns another freckle, to which a new freckle appears on his face.\n\nMorgan Freeman subsequently appears after the election ballots are found. He explains the reasoning behind why the [[China|Chinese]] wish to own ''Star Wars'' and the potential fate ''Star Wars'' would face if owned by Disney. Afterwards, multiple freckles appear one after another on his face.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nMorgan Freeman reappears at the end, where he explains the origin of [[Princess Kenny]], and her reason for betraying them and siding with the [[Big Bad Government Guy]]. Kyle asks him why he appears when something convoluted needs explaining, in the exact same manner as Stan did in \"[[Obama Wins!]]\", and Morgan Freeman replies with the exact same answer as he did in that episode.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nMorgan Freeman can be found running his own taco shop in South Park called [[Freeman's Tacos]]. Talking to him will cause him to teach the player how to craft items to enhance the player's powers. He is an optional mini-boss to battle, but only if the player provokes him repeatedly. If the player attempts to provoke him while their skin color is black, the dialog changes and he would not initiate combat.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]\" (mentioned only) - When [[Larry (\"Prehistoric Ice Man\")|Larry]] watches [[Steve Irwin]] on television, Irwin states that the grizzly bear he is wrestling has the strength of \"over ten Morgan Freemans\".\n*\"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\" - Reads five chapters of Butters' sequel to ''The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs''.\n*\"[[Obama Wins!]]\" - Seen at various times explaining the current setting.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Morgan Freeman]]\n[[zh:摩根·弗里曼]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Bosses]]"
