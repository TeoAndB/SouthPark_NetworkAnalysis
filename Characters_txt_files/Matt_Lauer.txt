He is mentioned in the episode \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", and appears physically in \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", [[The Boys|the boys]] along with [[Wendy Testaburger]] attempt to start a boy band, and create a music video with girls screaming how much they want them. Cartman directs the girls, [[Bebe Stevens]], [[Red]], [[Annie Knitts]], and [[Millie Larsen]], to behave as if they were [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. However the girls respond that they don't give a rat's ass about DiCaprio, but that they would go crazy for Matt Lauer.\n\nLauer appears along with his ''[[Today Show]]'' co-hosts in \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\", in which they interview [[Butters Stotch]] with his parents, for supposedly writing the horrifically vulgar and disgusting book ''[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (Book)|The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]''.\n\nDuring the interview, Lauer and the others praise Butters on the book, but are unable to keep themselves from vomiting whenever they attempt to read from the book. Lauer and the others appear again, on the day a second book, ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]]'', is unveiled and in which they get [[Morgan Freeman]] to read an excerpt from the book. They all have buckets prepared so as to vomit during the books more vulgar parts, however, Butters who lacks the literary and perverse mind of the Boys, proves incapable of writing a truly vulgar book, and the closest thing he has to foul language is constant use of the words \"Poop\" and \"Pee\".\n\nIn \"[[Member Berries]]\", Lauer serves as the host of HBC News' \"Commander-In-Chief Forum\". He proceeds to ask the Republican nominee, [[Herbert Garrison|Giant Douche]] if he has any viable plans if he were to win the election besides his promise to \"Fuck them all to death!\". He tries to blame his opponent, [[Hillary Clinton|Turd Sandwich]] and claim that he never said that, before Matt shows a collection of clips with him saying those exact words.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\"\n*\"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\"\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*In real life, Matt Lauer was fired from the TODAY Show in 2017 due to sexual harassment according to a complaint filed by a co-worker.\n*His appearance in \"[[Member Berries]]\" is based on NBC News' \"Commander-In-Chief Forum\", which Lauer hosted and had then-Republican presidential nominee, [[Donald Trump]] on to interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://youtu.be/-yNVAx68FB0|title=Donald Trump Participates in Commander-In-Chief Forum (Full) |publisher=NBC News}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n[[ja:マット・ローアー]]\n[[zh:马特·劳尔]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
