He was succeeded by President [[Herbert Garrison]] following the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n==Background==\n===\"[[About Last Night...]]\"===\nHe is a member of a professional thief organization. He and [[John McCain]] are both in this organization and both ran for presidency. If either won, they would have gained access to the presidential escape tunnel. This would allow them to execute an intricate plot to steal the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institute. They succeed in their efforts and fake their deaths, with the help of [[Ike Broflovski]]. They then planned to travel to an exotic island to live out the remainder of their lives. Obama, however, decides to actually give the presidency a chance along with [[Michelle Obama]].\n\n===\"[[Sexual Healing]]\"===\nPresident Obama is one of the lead members in the elaborate conspiracy to justify the actions of rich, successful men, who have been caught cheating on their spouses. He notes that the men were under the control of a [[Wizard Alien]], causing them to be addicted to sex.\n\nWhen [[Kyle Broflovski]] suggests that they need to learn to control their impulses, he and [[Butters Stotch]] are taken to the alien at Independence Hall. Once there, Barack Obama urges the boys to kill the alien, who in reality was a soldier wearing a costume. After the soldier is killed, Obama gives a speech reassuring others that if a rich, successful man is caught cheating, it would be because of a Wizard Alien.\n\n===\"[[Funnybot]]\"===\nPresident Obama told the public that [[Funnybot (Character)|Funnybot]] had planned an attack against the United States, using its and Russia's missiles. He stated that he would spend his last few hours on earth watching \"Madea\" movies with his family. He stated that he was embarrassed, but he could not help it.\n\n===\"[[Obama Wins!]]\"===\nPresident Obama makes a deal with [[General Tso]] to in order to get re-elected. The deal was that if Obama is re-elected, the Chinese will get the rights to ''[[wikipedia:Star Wars|Star Wars]]''. General Tso makes a deal with [[Eric Cartman]], which was that if Cartman steals the ballots and gives them to General Tso at [[Red Lobster]], then Cartman would get a role in the next ''Star Wars'' film. However, the deal is postponed due to [[Kyle Broflovski]] and others trying to stop Cartman. Cartman hides the ballots at a Hummer dealership. In the end, to protect the ''Star Wars'' franchise, everyone decides to burn the ballots, guaranteeing Obama a second term in office.\n\n===Other Appearances===\n*His first appearance was a brief cameo in \"[[Britney's New Look]]\", where he was in a political debate that was interrupted by \"Britney Watch\".\n*He was also mentioned in \"[[The Coon]]\" while showing the 'change' posters with 'When?' written in graffiti.\n*According to the Channel 9 News, he was credited as the reason the economy picked up in \"[[Margaritaville]]\", rather than [[Kyle Broflovski]], lampooning some of the surreal praise surrounding his campaign in 2008 by the media and general public.\n*In \"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\", a [[Terrance and Phillip]] episode involved one of them farting on Barack Obama, who is shown in a photograph to be a [[Canada|Canadian]] actor.\n*He appears in the crowd during \"[[201]]\" in [[Tom Cruise]]'s house supporting the lawsuit against the town, but is not seen in \"[[200]]\".\n*He was mentioned in \"[[Poor and Stupid]]\" when Cartman and Butters refer to him as \"fucking gay\".\n*The [[Duck President]] replaced him in \"[[Ass Burgers]]\" but he came back and appeared for several seconds near the end.\n*In \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\" he gives Kyle an award for his (fake) praise for Caitlyn Jenner, then applauds Caitlyn after she kills an elderly person.\n\n==Appearance==\nBarack Obama is African-American with short black hair, a long face, a large nose with a small mole and black eyebrows. He also has unusually shaped lips and wears a dark blue suit with a tie.

He is outgoing and confident in interactions with his staff and close allies. He is willing to resort to complex manipulation, inventing the '[[Wizard Alien]]' as an excuse for the various rich men having sex with many women, and he has ballots stolen to preserve his re-election as President.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[About Last Night...]]\"\n*\"[[Britney's New Look]]\"\n*\"[[Margaritaville]]\" - Gets credited for saving South Park from debt, which annoys Kyle.\n*\"[[Sexual Healing]]\"\n*\"[[201]]\" (cameo)\n*”[[Poor and Stupid]]” (mentioned)\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\"\n*\"[[Ass Burgers]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Obama Wins!]]\" - Gets re-elected president and is seen negotiating with the Chinese.\n*\"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\"\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" (quoted by [[Leslie Meyers]])\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - A drawing of Obama sucking \"adrenochrome\" from a child can be found on a [[Tutornon]] textbook.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n[[es:Barack Obama]]\n[[fr:Barack Obama]]\n[[ja:バラク・オバマ]]\n[[zh:贝拉克·奥巴马]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
