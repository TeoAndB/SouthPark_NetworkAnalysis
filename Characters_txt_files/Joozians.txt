They appear in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Cancelled]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe Joozians ignore [[The Boys|the boys']] plea to save the Earth at first while explaining that after 100 episodes, a TV series usually begins to decline in quality and is no longer profitable. They then take the boys to lunch, go to a [[Joozineks|topless bar]], and visit a prostitute's [[Adult Hotel|hotel room]]. \n\nThe two Joozians, find a \"joozinek\", then they gotten very high on \"glach\" at a \"hekmabah\" strip club, later begin sucking on each other's \"jagons\" and sticking their fingers into each other's \"thrushers\". [[Kenny McCormick]] takes a picture of them. The Joozians tried to prevent the boys from blackmailing them with the photograph unless they agree not to cancel ''Earth''. They do so and later erased everyone's memory of it being an intergalactic reality television show, with the photograph left being useful for the future.\n\n==Appearance==\nTheir skin is a dull yellow, with light brown markings on their heads, beady eyes, a big nose, and have four arms, antennas, and legs.\n\nThe first featured Joozian had dark-green hair and a beard. He wears a black suit with a red tie, a white dress shirt, dark-grey pants, orange shoes, and six bejeweled rings. The second featured Joozian had gray hair and wears a blue suit with a black tie, a white dress shirt, black pants, and red shoes. It was later shown they both wear white undergarments.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Joozians\">\n158a.jpg|The Joozians on [[South Park Studios]].\nCancelled085.png|Meeting [[The Boys]].\nCancelled087.png|The Joozians at a restaurant.\nCancelled091.png|Sniffing a little \"glach\".\nCancelled095.png|The Joozians with a prostitute.\nJoozian3.png|The Joozians performing a sexual act on each other.\nCancelled097.png|The Joozians with icepacks after a headache.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nThey are very business-minded and money-driven.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Their name is a play on the word \"jew\" and they display many negative Jewish cultural stereotypes, both physically and personality-wise.\n**This was also considered proven when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] eats a morsel of their dinner, with the fact he does have Jewish ancestry.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cancelled]]\" \n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the [[COVID-19|pandemic]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n[[zh:犹兹安星人]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]"
