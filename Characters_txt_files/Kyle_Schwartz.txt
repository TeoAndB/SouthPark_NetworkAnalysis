He has heavy breathing, due to asthma. He also has poor eyesight, for which he has large glasses and are likely for farsightedness, due to the magnification of his eyes. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[The Entity]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhile his mother is in the hospital, Kyle stays with the Broflovski family during the events of \"[[The Entity]]\". He is a stereotypical Jew (with characteristics such as hypochondria, poor athleticism and being good with money), unlike [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who is worried about his anti-Semitic friend [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], whom he fears will constantly make fun of him. Kyle then offers Cartman forty dollars not to make fun of Kyle Schwartz. Cartman initially tries to comply with the agreement, but later makes a concentration camp joke in class, blowing the deal.\n\nKyle Schwartz then states that Kyle (Broflovski) should have tried to get away with paying Cartman $12.50, instead of $40. Angered by his ingratitude and personal quirks, the boys help Kyle try to get rid of him. They put him on a sled tied to a bus headed for Connecticut, and later seal him in a box and place him on a plane to Antarctica. He nevertheless keeps returning to the Broflovski home. In the end, his mother's condition improves, and he decides to go home after receiving $5,000,000 from an investment bailout to the airlines. The boys suddenly see their opportunity and try to convince him to stay, but Kyle Schwartz replies by saying that he couldn't stand how everyone in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] is a stereotypical hillbilly jock redneck.\n\nKyle also appears in \"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\", where he calculates how many presents Cartman will get for Christmas, concluding that he will still owe two presents even if he finds a cure for cancer and [[AIDS]] before Christmas, and \"[[The Losing Edge]]\", where the boys play on the [[South Park Little League Baseball Team]] and have to get the worst person they can find to play because they do not want to qualify for a national tournament.\n\n===Talents===\nKyle Schwartz is very good with investing and other matters concerning money. He states that one day he would like to be an investment banker. He is cautious and avoids trouble—this may be the reason he keeps returning after all the times [[The Boys|the boys]] try to send him away.\n\n==Appearance==\nKyle's upper lip is pulled above his teeth and his brown \"Jewfro\" is parted in the middle. He wears a dark pink jacket with blue triangles across it, and light green pants. His eyes are shown to be green when his glasses are on, and they appear as black dots when they are off. He is somewhat overweight, with a larger body profile compared to most other kids, seen by his outfits and particularly in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where his stomach is shown protruding from his costume. In \"[[The Entity]]\", he has stated that he has lumps on the dorsal part of his hands.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Kyle Schwartz\">\n905_kck-up-to-bat.jpg|Kyle playing for South Park's team in \"[[The Losing Edge]]\".\n102a.jpg|Kyle on South Park Studios.\nKyle and Kyle.jpg|Kyle with Kyle.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nKyle's personality is representative of the stereotypical, nerdy Jew. He is able to handle money well, is a constant complainer, and is generally overly cautious. He also has various health issues, such as asthma and others.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Entity]]\" - Stays with the Broflovski family during the events of the episode.\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" - Helps Cartman count his naughty and nice deeds.\n*\"[[The Losing Edge]]\" - Tricked by the boys into joining their baseball team in order to lose the national circuit draft.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His voice is based on [[wikipedia:Tony Curtis|Tony Curtis's]] impression of Cary Grant in the movie ''[[wikipedia:Some Like It Hot|Some Like It Hot]]''. Tony Curtis's real name was Bernard Schwartz, which may explain Kyle's surname.\n*The name Juan Schwartz is also a pseudonym used by Trey Parker<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005295|title=Trey Parker|publisher=IMDb.com}}</ref> early in his career in the credits to the horror musical ''Cannibal: The Musical''. It is unknown if Kyle's last name was influenced by this.\n*Kyle's worrisome manner is very similar to that of [[w:c:familyguy:Mort Goldman|Mort Goldman]] of [[Family Guy]], who incidentally is also Jewish and wears glasses.\n*His need to eat fish instead of beef at dinner in \"[[The Entity]]\" was based on radio talk show host [[wikipedia:Dennis Prager|Dennis Prager]] who is also Jewish and wears glasses. The inspiration came after Trey and Matt had previously worked with Prager on the short film, ''[[wikipedia:For Goodness Sake|For Goodness Sake II]]'', where he would constantly ask his assistant to bring him fish for lunch.\n*Despite sharing the same first name with Kyle Broflovski, Cartman never once address him by his first name like he always does with Kyle Broflovski.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Broflovski Family}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[es:Kyle Schwartz]]\n[[fr:Kyle Schwartz]]\n[[it:Kyle Schwartz]]\n[[ja:カイル・シュワルツ]]\n[[ru:Кайл Шварц]]\n[[zh:凯尔·施瓦兹]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Broflovski / Schwartz family]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Nerds]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]"
