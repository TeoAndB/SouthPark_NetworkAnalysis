He was the host of ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' from 1992 until 2009, later returning in 2010, and had his final show on February 6, 2014. He first appear in the ''[[Jay Leno Short]]'', voiced by himself, where he spoke to the children of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] about Thanksgiving, only to hear jokes regarding his chin.\n\n==Background==\nHe later reappeared in \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" with an even larger chin, again playing himself, as [[Veronica Crabtree|Mrs. Crabtree]] performed comedy on his show.\n\nHe later reappeared in \"[[Fishsticks]]\", spreading the infamous joke. He was redesigned and [[Trey Parker]] now played his part. He also appeared in the episode \"[[Funnybot]]\" as one of the angry comedians, even threatening to kill [[Kenny McCormick]] with a bullet through the head.\n\nThough his chin is portrayed rather large (as it is in real life) in most of his appearances, it is far larger in \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" than in any episode before or after.\n\n==Appearance==\nJay Leno is most notable for his large chin and is drawn as a South Park character with an exaggerated chin. He wears a black suit, a white shirt, and black shoes. In the ''[[Jay Leno Short]]'', his tie was black but in \"[[Fishsticks]]\" he had a red tie. His hair color was originally dark brown but has since grayed significantly leaving only a small patch of brown left.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Jay Leno\">\nJay Leno 00005.png|Jay Leno in the \"[[Jay Leno Short]]'.\nJay Leno 00014.png|Jay Leno's chin can deploy a helicopter. \nJayleno.JPG|Jay Leno in \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[zh:杰·雷诺]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrity voice actors]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
