He is said to be the only happy child in the camp. Later, when he appears as one of the children caught by an ice cream truck for trying to escape from the camp, he claims that he can no longer stand without eating any candy. His parents eventually decide to take him out of the camp die to him not losing weight. At the end of the episode, [[Chad]] tells his parents and [[Rick and Susan|counselors]] that Cartman was selling candy to the campers.\n\n==Appearance==\nHorace wears the standard Hopeful Hills uniform, which consists of a short-sleeved shirt with blue details and the camp's logo, blue shorts, and black shoes. Outside camp, he wears a dark blue shirt and brown shorts. He is overweight and appears to be larger than the 4th graders. His hair is curly and brown.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Horace Sanders\" widths=\"160\">\nHorace1.png|Horace wearing the fat camp uniform.\nHorace2.png|Horace as the only happy child in the fat camp.\nHorace3.png|Horace discovers that the monster was just one of the counselors wearing a costume.\nHorace4.png|Horace as one of the children caught trying to escape.\nHorace5.png|Horace saying he would do anything to have a candy.\nHorace6.png|Horace and his parents.\nHorace7.png|Horace tells his parents why he is not losing weight.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHorace acts more childlike than the other children, believing that the greasy monster was real, until later realizing that he was just one of the [[Rick and Susan|counselors]] wearing a costume. This led Cartman to call him \"retarded\". He also seems to be concerned about his weight.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[zh:霍勒斯·桑德斯]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:5th graders]]"
