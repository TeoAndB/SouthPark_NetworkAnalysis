He spoke occasionally and was voiced by [[Trey Parker]]. He was killed off in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode \"[[Season Finale]]\" after he was run over by a police car.\n\n==Background==\nJason first appeared in the cafeteria during \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" as a background character, in a shot that was reused in \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" with some basic dialogue, but did not appear otherwise. A revised version of the character first appeared in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\" as a candidate for the boys' new fourth friend, making it past the first cut though he has no dialogue.\n\nHe made his first major speaking appearance in \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\", seen with [[Craig's Gang]] when they wore matching outfits as metrosexuals, alongside [[Craig Tucker]], [[Token Black]], and [[Tweek Tweak]]; he makes his only appearance in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] classroom in this episode.\n\nHe was also part of the group who helped recover the \"future telling device\" in \"[[Marjorine]]\", waiting with [[Timmy]] outside the containment center for the rest of the boys to return.\n\nIn \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" and \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" he is sitting with the main boys in the cafeteria and their extended friend group, including Craig, Token and Jimmy. In the latter episode, he explains what High School Musical is and expresses disbelief at the kids' lack of familiarity with the fad.\n\nIn \"[[Splatty Tomato]]\", his father [[Bob White]], mother [[Mrs. White]] and sister [[Crystal White]] are first introduced, and he is shown to be part of their family when his parents complain to [[PC Principal]] that the school is too liberal and causing his kids to be afraid of [[Herbert Garrison|the President]]. Jason looks at the floor and does not speak throughout the scene. When his parents later try to free the President at the end of the episode and his family summons him, he similarly looks at the ground and does not speak.\n\n==Personality==\nJason was known for his playful nature among the townspeople, and seemed well-liked among his classmates, frequently invited to larger gatherings or to play games. He participated in many of the other children's role-playing games, playing along under even Cartman's authority as a Border Patrol agent in the Texans vs. Mexicans game and dedicating himself to the role of an elven shopkeeper in the boys' fantasy role-playing game. He was especially known for his love of sports, however. He was known as a member of both the South Park Cows' basketball team as well as the football and soccer teams, and had a reputation for enjoying playing sports in his free time as well, joining the kids for games of football on the playground and at the park. He also expressed once that a football game would be less fun to watch if knowing the outcome in advance. At his funeral, [[Father Maxi]] observed it was his playful nature with sports that lead to his untimely death.\n\nJason seemed embarrassed or intimidated by his [[Bob White|father's]] outbursts, remaining silent and often looking down or away from him, though he was evidently surprised when his father pulled out a weapon. He is never seen speaking in his parents' presence. He was also evidently obedient to their demands, as after his death, his mother remarks that he did not use his phone outside of designated phone hours. His family was later shown hitting their subsequently adopted child, [[Alejandro White]] for misbehaving, suggesting Jason's reluctance to speak and obedience may have been a result of similar abuse. \n\nJason's quiet nature stood in contrast to his parents, who were known for their outspoken nature among the other adults, and often seemed to prefer following the other students, like [[Craig Tucker]], and seemed concerned about what was popular, expressing his surprise that the boys were unfamiliar with ''High School Musical'' and citing its popularity with their age group. He often spoke up when expressing disbelief or surprise, such as when the boys succeeded in capturing a leprechaun, or when [[Butters Stotch]] exposed himself at a volleyball game. He often appeared rather stoic or expressionless in serious situations however, even compared to other background characters, watching blankly when [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] gets crushed to death by the [[Giant Reptilian Bird]] or when [[Snooki]] sinisterly appears behind Cartman during \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\", in which everyone appears to be concerned apart from him.\n\nCartman observed in his opinion that Jason \"couldn't catch\" and suggested that he had been clumsy, blaming this for his death being ran over by [[Park County Police Force|police officer's vehicle]] when he tried to catch a ball Cartman had thrown in the street, although this could be seen as avoiding blame for Jason's death considering Cartman was the one who threw it.\n\n==Appearance==\nJason has dark brown hair with noticeable sideburns and a high forehead with a receded hairline. He wears a purple jacket and a pair of blue jeans, which were originally dark gray. In \"[[The Hobbit]]\", Wendy mentions that he has freckles. His character is based on [[wikipedia:Jason McHugh|Jason McHugh]], who was featured with [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] in ''Cannibal! The Musical'' and ''Orgazmo''.\n\n==Friendships==\n[[File:Marjorine97.png|thumb|left|120px|Jason, with [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]] and [[Francis]].]]\nJason's friendships were never well-defined in his appearances. He was most notably a member of [[Craig's Gang]] during the metrosexual fad in \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\", but by the next season he was no longer considered a member of the group. He still occasionally sat with them and [[The Boys]] at lunch, particularly during the twelfth season, though this spot has also been filled by [[Tweek Tweak]] and [[Kevin Stoley]] depending on the episode, and in larger sequences, he continued to appear alongside the groups, such as eating pizza in \"[[Margaritaville]]\" and at Cartman's viewing party in \"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\". \n\nHis closest friend may have been Tweek. Both boys appeared in Craig's Gang during the meterosexual fad, and then were no longer with them in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\", but continued to appear together. They were seen together most notably when they were invited together to a party at [[Bebe Stevens]]' home during the Stupid Spoiled Whore fad. They are also next to each other in \"[[Marjorine]]\", \"[[Night of the Living Homeless]]\" and \"[[Imaginationland]]\". He also may have been friendly with Token outside the group, as they were both on the same Cows basketball team together. Tweek was noticeably more upset with Jason's death than their other classmates present. \n\nCartman once referred to himself as \"pretty close\" with Jason, and they seemed to be friendly. Jason was among the boys who helped him to trap Kyle at the nearby [[Sizzler]] during the Jersey invasion effort, where [[DogPoo Petuski]] and [[Bill Allen]] were also present. He and Dogpoo were also both invited to play Texans vs. Mexicans at Cartman's House, where they both served as Border Patrol agents for Cartman. Dogpoo was also present for Jason's death. He also played with Bill on the basketball team and appeared next to him in \"[[The Hobbit]]\" when Wendy discussed the boys' flaws. He and Bill both joined Tweek in the PlayStation 4 Army in \"[[Black Friday]]\". \n\nHe was also often seen nearby or talking with Kevin Stoley, implying a possible friendship, such as at Cartman's House in \"[[Marjorine]]\" or during the volleyball game in \"[[Wieners Out]]\".\n\nStaring in \"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\", he was often seen sitting by [[Scott Malkinson]], [[Tommy Turner]], [[Daniel Tanner]], and a few unidentified background characters in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]].\n\n==Video games==\n====''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''====\nJason plays a minor role in the game as a member of the Drow Elf faction, tending the armory at the Elven Kingdom and acting as the faction's merchant. You have to buy equipment from him to befriend him. This is one of the few times he speaks, and the only time you interact with him in the game, though he appears in the cutscenes.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nHe can be found in the [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]] restaurant and [[The New Kid]] can get a selfie with him if they have at least one active [[Class:Brutalist|brutalist]] ability.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nJasonsouthpark.png|Jason on [[South Park Studios]].\nJason1.png|Jason as one of the 20 boys selected to be [[The Boys]]' new friend in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\".\nJason2.png|Jason receiving a rose after making it to the second round.\nJason3.png|Jason being eliminated as a candidate in the third round.\nJason4.png|Jason angry at [[Kevin Stoley]] in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\".\nJason5.png|Jason, as Legolas, from behind.\nJason18.jpg|Jason as part of [[Craig Tucker]]'s 'metrogang' in \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\"\nJason6.png|Jason walking past the girls who find him and [[Tweek Tweak]] attractive in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\nJason7.png|Jason building the room for the 'future telling device' in \"[[Marjorine]]\".\nJason8.png|Jason arguing with the other boys about who gets to use the device first.\nJason9.png|Jason hunting a leprechaun in \"[[Imaginationland]]\".\nJason10.png|Jason about to see how he ranks in attractiveness, according to the girls, in \"[[The List]]\".\nJason11.png|Jason's brief cameo as he watches [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] fight [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\".\nJason12.png|Jason singing and dancing in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\".\nJason13.png|Jason as a basketball player in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\".\nJason14.png|Jason going to [[Eric Cartman]]'s house to watch ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'' in \"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\".\nJason15.png|Jason on the floor about to watch ''Terrance and Phillip''.\nJason16.png|Jason meeting with Cartman and other children in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\".\nJason17.png|Jason from the side in \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\".\nMarjorine18.png|Jason alongside Tweek and Kevin.\nMarjorine86.png|Jason and the rest of the boys outside the containment center in \"[[Marjorine]]\".\nDoucheAndADanish00002.png|Jason and the other boys in \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\".\nJason stupid spoiled whore png.png|Jason at Bebe's party.\nButtersBottomBitch013.png|Sitting at lunch with other children.\nTheLastOfTheMeheecans003.png|Playing Texans vs. Mexicans.\nJason and Kevin.png|Jason and Kevin.\nJason gun.png\nScreenshot 20191107-043654.jpg|Jason's death in \"[[Season Finale]]\".\nJason Memorial.jpg|Jason's memorial photograph as seen in \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*''[[The Unaired Pilot]]'' - Seen talking to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in the cafeteria and says \"Yeah, I think we need weedkiller.\"\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - A prototypical version of him is seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Seen in the scene recycled from ''[[The Unaired Pilot]]''.
