Thomas and Nellie perform a shaman-esque ritual to exorcise [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] soul from Cartman's body. Although they are successful in exorcising Kenny's soul, they are unable to re-seal it because Chef hadn't brought a victim child to sacrifice. Instead, Kenny finds his way into a pot roast Nellie was preparing.\n\nHis most recent appearance to date is in \"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\", where he are seen along with Chef in a crowd during the town's Christmas celebration.
