"{{South Park character\n|name = Corey Lanskin\n|image = corey-lanskin.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Dirty Blond\n|job = Student, Minecraft Teacher\n|appearance = \"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\"\n}}\n'''Corey Lanskin''' is a boy that pretends to be English, teaching ''[[Minecraft]]'' to adults for a fee in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCorey is sought out by the adults who want him to teach them ''Minecraft'', so they can remove the television block on their \"murder porn\". While he originally refuses to teach them, he is soon persuaded by [[Randy Marsh]]'s offer of \"a hundred ounces of silver\". He takes them into his basement, which is loaded with multiple computer workstations, and uses a London cockney accent to instruct them, rather than his usual, childlike voice.\n\nWhen [[the boys]] later come to his house, asking if he taught the adults how to play ''Minecraft'', he tricks them by playing dumb. However, [[Eric Cartman]] catches on to the lie before they leave and they enter his house. They soon discover Corey's basement, filled with adults, and tell him that they were using ''Minecraft'' to block the adults from \"watching spousal homicide shows\". Corey tells them that to stop \"murder porn\", they have to talk to the [[Get Cable Company|cable company]].\n\n==Personality==\nCorey acts like English actor [[Wikipedia:Michael_Caine|Michael Caine]] whenever he is teaching the adults ''Minecraft''. He reverts to his normal American accent when manipulating children and adults when confronted about his scheme. In the end, Corey talks in his normal accent after being exposed by the boys. \n\n==Appearance==\nCorey has dirty blond hair in separated locks, as well as prominent ears and pink freckles on his face. He wears an orange T-shirt and gray pants. He walks around with a pink lollipop in his hand or sometimes a cigarette.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n[[es:Corey Lanskin]]\n[[fr:Corey Lanskin]]\n[[zh:科里·兰斯金]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
