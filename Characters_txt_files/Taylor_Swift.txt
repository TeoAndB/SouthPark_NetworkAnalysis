She was featured in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, \"[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]\".\n\n==Background==\nTaylor Swift is one of the guest stars on the ''[[Washington Redskins: Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special]]''. She is first seen in the trailer for the special, where she sits with [[Bill Cosby]], declining a drink. Swift and Cosby perform a duet, \"''[[Baby It's Cold Outside]]\"'' in its traditional way (one of the performers trying to seduce the other), for the special. Taylor acts out her role, trying to decline Cosby. The act is later disturbed by the appearance of the YouTuber, [[PewDiePie]]. The sound of the performance is muted, while [[Eric Cartman]] and PewDiePie argue. The show still continues in the background, escalating to Cosby getting Swift to drink and him approaching her, rubbing her cheek. PewDiePie then takes control of the show and instead of the special, it now shows the gameplay of the video game: ''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''.\n\n== Appearance ==\nLike the real Taylor, the character is a young blonde-haired woman, with red lipstick and blush. She wears a purple v-neck short-armed shirt and a brown long skirt. Her dangle earrings are dark blue and yellow/gold. She is later seen wearing a brown jacket on top of her attire. Her outfit is based on Esther Williams' appearance when she performs ''Baby, it's Cold Outside'' with Ricardo Montalbán in the film ''Neptune's Daughter''.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Taylor Swift\">\nHappyHolograms00072.png|Swift and Cosby on the Holiday Special, along with Eric Cartman and PewDiePie.\nCosbySwiftConcept.jpg|Concept art for Swift and Cosby in ''[[#HappyHolograms]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Faith Hilling]]\" (mentioned only) - A m[[List of Memes#\"Taylor Swifting\"|eme]] is named after her: \"Taylor Swifting\".\n*\"[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]\" - She performed during the ''Holiday Special''.\n*\"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\" - The YouTube links to the music videos of her songs \"Bad Blood\" and \"Wildest Dreams\" appear in [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]]'s internet history.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*In the episode \"[[Moss Piglets]]\", her 2017 single \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\" is played after [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] experiment with their water bears.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eighteen}}\n[[es:Taylor Swift]]\n[[zh:泰勒·斯威夫特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by April Stewart]]"
