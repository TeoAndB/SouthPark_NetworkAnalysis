He first appears in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, \"[[Safe Space]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Safe Space]]\", the cashier pressurizes [[Randy Marsh]] to donate a dollar to feed hungry kids every time he shops at Whole Foods. He constantly guilt-trips Randy for not donating, making it extremely difficult for Randy to make his payment or collect his change. Some things Randy is forced to do are to tap on a window in a register, speak into a decoder, and pull a very tight sandwich out of the new change dispenser, a hungry girl's mouth, to collect his change. On his third trip to Whole Foods, Randy is so pressured that he decides to donate a dollar during checkout. The cashier shames him for only donating $1, making an announcement, giving Randy a $1 donor t-shirt, and pining a picture of him up on a cork board while singing \"He's a Jolly Good Fellow\". Randy leaves Whole Foods whimpering.\n\nFollowing the incident, Randy makes a public service announcement against charity-shaming.\n\nOn his next trip to Whole Foods, Randy is accompanied by [[Steven Seagal]] and [[Vin Diesel]], to prevent the cashier from charity-shaming him. However, the cashier makes fun of their movies, causing both of them to walk off crying. He then asks Randy if he would like to donate again. On his final visit, Randy tells the cashier about his #ShamelessAmerica charity organization. The cashier then pressures him to  to help his pet hamster go to college.\n\nThe cashier is briefly seen again in \"[[Truth and Advertising]]\", still working as a cashier and asking [[Stephen Stotch|Stephen]] to give a dollar to give hungry kids iPads.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Whole Foods cashier has dark brown hair with gray sideburns and wrinkles on his forehead. He wears a cashier's uniform consisting of a blue striped shirt, a black Whole Foods apron, dull blue pants, and white shoes. He wears a black watch on his left wrist.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a confident, sarcastic bully. He smiles coolly while pressuring Randy to donate to charity, making it very difficult for him to make payment. He is able to gain the upper hand, ridiculing Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel to get them out of the way so he can continue charity-shaming Randy.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Safe Space]]\" - Charity-shames Randy.\n*\"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" - Seen working at Whole Foods Market.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n[[zh:全食超市收银员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
