The operator tells them they need an adult with them, so they pay a homeless guy to let them in.\n\nRick's most prominent appearance is in \"[[The Passion of the Jew]]\". In this episode, he lets [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] watch ''The Passion of the Christ'' as he believes it is an important film that everyone should watch. He later joins [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s rally to kill all the Jews (believing, along with the others that it is a rally to celebrate the movie). He, along with the others, lose their faith in [[Mel Gibson]] after seeing what a lunatic he really is.\n\nIn \"[[Handicar]]\", a different ticket operator is seen, suggesting that the original ticket operator left or was fired. In \"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\", he is seen working at Burger King.\n\n==Appearance==\nRick wears the standard ticket operator uniform, which consists of a white jacket under a red vest. He also wears a thin black tie, dark blue pants, and black shoes. He has black hair that forms a widow's peak and is usually seen inside the ticket booth. Rick seems to be underweight.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Rick\" spacing=\"small\">\nRick1.png|Rick's first appearance.\nRick2.png\nRick3.png|Rick as the local manager of the Burger King store.\nBijou guy.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nRick seems very dedicated to his job, not letting the boys watch an R rated movie in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. His attitude changes in \"[[The Passion of the Jew]]\" when he lets Kyle watch ''The Passion'' even though he's underage.\n\n==Prominence==\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Denies the boys entry until they pay a homeless man to pretend to be their guardian.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Denies Cartman's pubes as payment for tickets.\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - Tells everyone that they can't come in when the cinema uses the \"You Can't Come\" technique.\n*\"[[Free Hat]]\" - Denies the kids their money back.\n*\"[[The Passion of the Jew]]\" - Joins Cartman's rally.\n*\"[[AWESOM-O]]\" - Seen looking at Butters and Cartman (as [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]]).\n*\"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" - Seen at the cinema when Cartman leaves.\n*\"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\" - Works at Burger King and gets irritated by [[Randy Marsh]] selling his own plant-based burgers.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nRick is seen when [[Douchebag|the New Kid]] goes to Bijou Cinema. He tells the kid he can't see ''Asses of Fire 2'' as he is underage. He later becomes a zombie but is not fought.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nWhenever the New Kid fights [[Chaos Kids|Chaos Minions]] outside the theatre, Rick will stay in his booth and make fun of the new kid's costumes and special effects.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Matt Stone]] has stated that he feels that the booth operator is the same as the Squirt Scout Master seen in [[Jewbilee]] as they have a similar design and have the same voice. This Scout Master was named [[Schlomo]]. However, it was confirmed in \"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\" that the Ticket Guy is called \"Rick\" so they are not the same person.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[pl:Rick]]\n[[pt-br:Rick]]\n[[zh:瑞克（影院售票员）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:Nerds]]"
