During a spellbook reading, Chip recited a hex that turned him into a real witch. He kidnapped several children, including [[Heidi Turner]], before being killed by a laser fired from a satellite by order of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]].\n\n==Appearance==\nChip has blonde hair and some stubble. After turning into a witch, his appearance changed dramatically. His blonde hair grew long and raggedy, his chin and nose became distorted, and blemishes appeared on his face like that of a typical witch. Under his eyes was a vibrant, green glow, and a permanent smile was plastered across his face that gave him an even more menacing appearance.\n\nHe wore traditional witch attire: a pointy hat, robe, gloves and boots. The robe became tattered during his witch transformation and he carried around an old broom which he used for transportation.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the commentary for the episode, Matt and Trey state that they considered having one of the kids' dads be the 'evil witch' but decided to use a new character instead, creating Chip Duncan.\n*He and Garrison are the only members of the Crack and Jack Witch Week group who are not known to have children.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-One}}\n[[es:Chip Duncan]]\n[[fr:Chip Duncan]]\n[[zh:奇普·邓肯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
