He appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode \"[[Jewpacabra]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Jewpacabra]]\", he was seen in his office with a few of his employees listening to [[Eric Cartman]] discuss the Jewpacabra. Although initially skeptical about Cartman's discovery, Billings eventually decided to provide Cartman with whatever resources he needed to capture the Jewpacabra, which included a trip to a resort called The Atlantis Hotel and Casino in the city of Nassau in the Bahamas.\n\nCartman only wanted to go to the hotel because it had a water slide that went through a shark tank. Upon returning to Colorado, Billings' team and Cartman take his video to the [[Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization]] to be analyzed. After viewing the video, the [[Bigfoot Researchers]] decided the Jewpacabra was a real entity.\n\nThat night, Cartman held himself up in a church while [[Token Black]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Butters Stotch]] kept guard. They got scared and went to [[Wingstreet]] for chicken wings. Billings and his team then took Cartman to the cite of the [[Easter Egg Hunt|Easter egg hunt]] to be used as a sacrifice for the Jewpacabra.\n\nThe following day, after Cartman had his nightmare and [[Kyle Broflovski]] brought him home, Billings and his assistant conducted the Easter egg hunt as planned. They were extremely excited to announce that Sooper Foods was ranked 4 in the fun category and 6 in the safety category.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Billings wears a brown suit consisting of brown pants, a black belt, a white shirt, a maroon tie with dark red stripes, and a brown coat. He has wavy gray hair and also wears his [[Sooper Foods]] name tag.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n\n[[zh:比林斯先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]"
