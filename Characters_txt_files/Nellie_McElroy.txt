Her first appearance was in the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[The Succubus]]\", where she comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] with [[Thomas McElroy|her husband]] for Chef's wedding.\n\n==Background==\nShe made a second appearance in the [[Season Six]] episode, \"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\". Chef takes [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] to his parents' manor house in Scotland. She performs a shaman-esque ritual to exorcise [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] soul from Cartman's body. Although she is successful in exorcising Kenny's soul she is unable to re-seal it because Chef hadn't brought a victim child to sacrifice. Instead, Kenny finds his way into a pot roast Nelle was preparing, much to her dismay.\n\nHer most recent appearance to date is in \"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\", where she is seen along with Chef in a crowd during the town's Christmas celebration. She is not seen at Chef's funeral in \"[[The Return of Chef]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nShe appears to be very old, with wrinkles and grey hair. She has a full head of curly grey hair and wears a yellow dress and a pearl necklace. Her eyes seem to be perpetually closed. She also appears to carry a small blue handbag around. In \"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\", she appears in full voodoo regalia, with a long white robe, an intricate mask and headdress, fake wings and one scepter in each hand.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Nelle McElroy\">\nBiggestDoucheintheUniverse11.jpg|Nellie McElroy performs an exorcism on Cartman to remove [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s soul.\nBiggestDoucheintheUniverse15.jpg|Nellie offers Kenny's soul tree-fiddy.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nShe appears to be friendly, being very accommodating to [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Eric Cartman]] when they visit her house in \"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\". Nellie appears to be a little senile and over-concerned with household duties, worrying about Kenny's spirit getting all over the curtains and her pot roast, and occasionally muttering things to herself.\n\n==Family==\n===[[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy]]===\nShe appears to have a good relationship with her son, Chef. He lives in the [[United States|USA]], and she appears to miss him a lot. When he appeared at their doorstep in Scotland she was overjoyed to see him again.\n\n===[[Thomas McElroy]]===\nNellie and Thomas both love each other very much. They argue constantly over their frequent encounters with the Loch Ness monster.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Succubus]]\" - Comes down to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] for Chef's wedding.\n*\"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\" - [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]] brings [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Liane Cartman|his mom]] to see his parents to help them exorcise [[Kenny McCormick]]'s spirit from Cartman's body.\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" - Seen in the crowd with Chef during the Christmas celebrations.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Thomas y Nelles McElroy]]\n[[it:Nelle McElroy]]\n[[zh:内莉·麦克尔罗伊]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
