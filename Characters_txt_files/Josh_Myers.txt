"{{South Park character\n|name = Josh Myers\n|image = Josh-myers.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Black\n|job = Prison Inmate\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0761293/|title=\"Toilet Paper\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Toilet Paper]]\"\n}}\n{{LinkDisambig|Josh (Disambiguation)}}\n'''Josh Myers''' appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Toilet Paper]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe is an inmate at the [[Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall]]. Josh advises [[Officer Barbrady]] in apprehending the children who toilet-papered [[Mrs. Streibel]]'s house.\n\nHe appears to be a parody of the character, Hannibal Lecter, from the crime novels by Thomas Harris, with similar hairstyles, mannerisms and voice, and the need to be kept under maximum security.\n\nJoshua easily psychologically manipulated Officer Barbrady to get what he wants from him in a similar fashion to the way Clarice Starling is manipulated in ''Silence of the Lambs''. When let out of his cell, he was strapped to a hand-cart with a special mask.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has thin eyebrows, long blackish hair, a light blue suit, and black shoes. His eyes are not joined together, possibly as a reference to the appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is somewhat manipulative, even making [[Officer Barbrady]] break down in tears, although, this could also be explained by Barbrady's low intelligence. Josh is also clearly a 'bad boy', if you will, being in juvenile hall and toilet papering over 600 houses in one year, as mentioned by the police officer. Otherwise, Josh is tough and sneaky, able to break out of the metal hand-cart (although he only had three weeks left before his release).\n\nJosh also has an obsession with upping his game at the mere sight of toilet paper.  Once broken out, the last seen of him was himself approaching the white house, armed with two boxes of Toilet paper.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\nA poster of him can be seen at the police station.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Josh can be seen behind [[Barbrady]]'s car in the introduction of [[Season Seventeen]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n\n[[pl:Josh Myers]]\n[[zh:乔什·迈尔斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]"
