They made their only appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Eric Cartman]] wants to know who his father is, he asks his [[Liane Cartman|mother]] who tells him about the [[Drunken Barn Dance]], where she met the Ute Tribe's [[Chief Running Water]]. This prompts Cartman to visit their reservation and talk to Chief Running Water, who tells him what happened after his encounter with Liane.\n\nThough the entire tribe itself does not appear, Chief Running Water makes a brief non-speaking cameo appearance in \"[[201]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Ute Tribe members wear multicolored shirts and pants. A few of them wear hats as well.\n[[zh:尤特部落]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
