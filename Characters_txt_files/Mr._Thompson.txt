Thompson interrupts and points out that since his wife has ovarian [[cancer]], she cannot have children. Garrison responds flamboyantly to him that he should consider having an [[AIDS]] test because his wife is \"a dude\", referring to Thompson as a \"faggot\". Garrison then proudly remarks that he is \"back\", displaying his flamboyant, homophobic tendencies from earlier seasons, and celebrates.\n\nWhen [[PC Principal]] arrives in town in \"[[Stunning and Brave]], he mentions hearing in his research about a \"teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test\", referring to the interaction with Thompson. Garrison simply laughs it off as he had been a \"lesbian\" at the time.\n\nMr. Thompson attends school meetings in multiple episodes including \"[[Sarcastaball]]\", \"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" and \"[[SUPER HARD PCness]]\".\n\nIn \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\", Mr. Garrison confuses him with a different [[Thompson]], asking the older man if he had ever gotten \"that AIDS test\" he mentioned to this character.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has dark brown hair that is balding on top of his head that seems slightly messy, with sideburns and a mustache. He wears a white sleeved-shirt with short sleeves and a prominent collar, and a dark brown vest with a diamond-shaped, blue and chartreuse pattern on it. He wears dark gray pants.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Eek, A Penis!]]\"\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" - Seen when the school is held hostage by the Germans.\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\" - Seen attending the [[Sarcastaball PTA Meeting]] in the library.\n*\"[[Taming Strange]]\" - Seen with the other teachers when they discuss the Intellilink software.\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" - Mentioned by PC Principal.\n*\"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" - Seen at [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Bar]].\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" - Seen in the crowd outside [[Whole Foods Market]] at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Seen singing [[Put It Down (Song)|the song]] at the climax.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Seen in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]] during a meeting.\n*\"[[SUPER HARD PCness]]\" - Seen with other teachers at a school meeting and later in the [[South Park Elementary Gymnasium|gymnasium]].\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - mentioned by Herbert Garrison.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n[[zh:汤普森老师]]\n[[Category:School faculty]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
