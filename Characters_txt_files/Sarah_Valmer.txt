She first appears in \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\", suspecting Jimmy has joined a gang.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Fishsticks]]\", she offers Jimmy and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] fruits and vegetables for a snack to replace Cartman's chips, before saving Jimmy from a black widow spider. Cartman would later misremember both events, with himself killing the spider, and Sarah bringing them chips and telling him he's \"handsome and not even remotely fat\".\n\n==Appearance==\nSarah wears a white shirt with a noticeable amount of cleavage, underneath is an orange sleeveless dress, with a white belt around her waist. Her hair is almost wavy, long and black, and like most of the moms in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], she wears red lipstick. Her breasts seem to be quite large and full-shaped, this being different from most of the South Park women, who are often portrayed as flat until they take off their shirt.\n\n==Personality==\nLittle is known about her personality, but she apparently can get very emotional, as in [[Krazy Kripples]], when she and Ryan try to get Jimmy out of the gang he's joined, but when he refuses, she bursts into tears.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Krazy Kripples]]\" - Tries to get her son out of a gang.\n*\"[[South Park is Gay!]]\" - She and the other wives find the metrosexual fad to be great at first, but quickly becomes annoyed with it.\n*\"[[Up the Down Steroid]]\" - Beaten by Jimmy when she comes to defend his girlfriend.\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - She and her husband have a talk with Jimmy about his erections in the classroom.\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" - Seen in the crowd at the town's meeting.\n*\"[[Fishsticks]]\" - Offers Jimmy fishsticks when he works on the joke.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\"\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\"\n*\"[[The Magic Bush]]\" - Seen at the [[Tucker Residence]].\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\" - Seen socializing in the street after the internet was reset.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\" - Participates in a meeting with the other parents.
