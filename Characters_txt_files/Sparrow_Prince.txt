"{{South Park character\n|name = Sparrow Prince\n|image = SparrowPrince.transparent.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Sparrow\n|hair = Red Feathers\n|job = Prince\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/400620|title=FAQ - South Park Studios|publisher=southparkstudios.com}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Sparrow Prince''' is a sparrow-ghost who first appeared in the [[Season Six]] episode, \"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe helped [[Lemmiwinks]], and presumably, [[Paris Hilton]], escape from [[Mr. Slave]]'s digestive system. He appears again in \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\" and appears to the public in order to get help from the [[South Park Elementary]] students. He and the students go and retrieve Lemmiwinks, so he can stop his older brother, [[Wikileaks]] from posting a story on [[Eavesdropper]] that would destroy the reputation of South Park Elementary forever.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:TheDeathCampofTolerance102.png|left|thumb]]\nThe Sparrow Prince appears as a semi-translucent, ghost-sparrow with red feathers, tan legs, and a white neck. He wears a blue cape, held together with a silver brooch, a purple belt, and a silver crown. He can be seen wearing a teal and gold sheath, which holds his similarly colored sword.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Sparrow Prince had a female-like voice in his first appearance. Later, his voice changed into a male but mellow voice.\n*Sparrow Prince claims that he had been stuck in Mr. Slave's body for years prior Lemmiwinks meeting him there, meaning it could be that he alongside the Frog King and Catatafish were also once inserted as normal animals (whose skeletons can be seen near his anus area) into Mr. Slave's ass before they died there.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]\"\n*\"[[Bass to Mouth]]\"\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nDuring the [[Beat Up Clyde]] quest, [[The New Kid]] faces the Sparrow Prince while in Mr. Slave's ass, and engages him in battle.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[es:Principe Gorrion]]\n[[zh:麻雀王子]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Enemies]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
