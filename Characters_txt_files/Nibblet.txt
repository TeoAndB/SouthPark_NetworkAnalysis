He appears in \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\". Nibblet does not seem to serve a purpose and is shown being extremely clumsy, but he helped capture the pirate ghosts in a net (only to have them dissipate shortly after).\n\n==Appearance==\nNibblet is a yellow, anthropomorphic bird-like creature with large wings, a red nose, an oddly-shaped head featuring springy antennae, and a short body. He can sometimes be seen with a bag of potato chips.\n==Quotes==\n'''Nibblet''': \"Nibblet likes potato chips.\" from \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Nibblet and the design of Korn band members was a homage to the Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[wikipedia:Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You]]'' that ran from 1969 to 1972.\n*A purple Nibblet toy can be seen being destroyed by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] in the episode \"[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\", when he goes into a frenzy and breaks all of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' toys in his bedroom.\n*Nibblet's name was likely derived from \"Niblet\", a term for a single kernel of corn.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[es:Nibblet]]\n[[zh:羽米鹂]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Imaginationland characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
