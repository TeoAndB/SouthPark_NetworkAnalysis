Like several Canadian celebrities, including [[Tom Green]] in \"[[Fat Camp]]\" and [[Justin Bieber]] in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\", despite being Canadian, she does not resemble the stereotypical Canadian, such as [[Terrance and Phillip|Terrance or Phillip]].\n\n==Appearance==\nAlanis has messy, black, mid-arm length hair.
