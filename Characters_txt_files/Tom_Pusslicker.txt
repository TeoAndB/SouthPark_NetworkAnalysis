He was frequently seen in episodes where unusual things occur on a large scale. He has not been seen reporting since the eleventh season and has been replaced by other anchors and reporters, most notably [[Tom Thompson]].\n\nOn occasion, the news report relevant to the episode would be preceded by the last lines of an otherwise unheard report about [[Hillary Clinton]]'s ass.\n\nHe briefly returns in \"[[Sponsored Content]]\" as one of the former news anchors introducing [[Jimmy Valmer]] to [[Leslie Meyers]].\n\n==Appearance==\nTom is usually seen wearing a gray suit with a white shirt and tie. The color of his tie tends to change between appearances, including dark red, blue and green. He has brown hair, usually dark but occasionally lighter. In \"[[Sponsored Content]]\", he now has a lapel on his suit and visible sleeves.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Tom Pusslicker\">\nHillaryclinton2.JPG|\"''...but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.''\"\nTomTruthandAdvertising.png|Tom as one of the former news reporters in \"Truth and Advertising\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*There is some confusion over Tom's actual name, as it has since been seen that most news anchors in the show are referred as Tom regardless, and many other reporters such as [[Chris Swollenballs]] bear some resemblance to Tom. His last name was confirmed to be Pusslicker in \"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\".\n**In \"[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]\" where Tom was replaced by another reporter with black hair, and Tom was referred to as Dan Akawa.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Volcano]]\" - reports on the eruption of [[Mount Evanston]].\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - reports on [[Clone Stan Marsh]]'s rampage through town.\n*\"[[Death]]\" - reports on parents' efforts to take [[Terrance and Phillip]] off the air.\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - reports on the [[MIR Space Station]] crash.\n*\"[[Damien]]\" - appears at [[Satan]]'s press conference.\n*\"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\" - reports on [[Kyle Broflovski]] finding the Triangle of Zinthar.\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\" - reports on [[Officer Barbrady]]'s leave of absence and subsequent anarchy.\n*\"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" - reports on the missing children.\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\" - reports on the Giant Snake and advises people to stay home.\n*\"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" - reports on the film festival.\n*\"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" - reports on the [[Tantalus V.
