He first appeared in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\".\n\nHe is the main news anchorman in [[Season Nineteen]], [[Season Twenty]] and most of [[Season Twenty-One]], but is shifted into acting as a reporter afterward.\n\n==Background==\nBill became the news anchor for the Channel 4 Evening News. His former colleagues, including [[Newsmen|Tom]] and Kevin Jarvis, remember him for his work at WCFO and for being a douchebag at the conventions. They believe him to be a sellout and believe he is working for the evil advertisements trying to destroy humanity, but he remains the main anchor for a while after [[Leslie Meyers]]' defeat. \n\nFrom \"[[Dead Kids]]\" on, he appears to be an on-location reporter instead. \n\nDuring the [[COVID-19]] Pandemic, he became jealous that young people like him are being denied [[COVID-19 Vaccine|vaccine]], and older people are getting theirs, and begins lashing out on his partner [[Tom (Newsman)|Tom]] while on the air when they report on stories about vaccinations.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\" - Debut.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - Cameo.\n*\"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" - Cameo.\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\"\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\"\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\"\n*\"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\"\n*\"[[Doubling Down]]\"\n*\"[[Splatty Tomato]]\"\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\" - no dialogue; reporting at [[South Park Elementary]] for recent shootings.\n*\"[[Unfulfilled]]\"\n*\"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\"\n*\"[[Turd Burglars]]\"\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Reported on the students' escape from [[South Park Elementary]].\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Constantly gets into arguments with the [[Tom (Newsman)|anchorman]].\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nHe appears as the newscaster for ''Good Morning South Park'' which is shown at the end of [[The Bowels of the Beast]], [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]] and [[The Thin White Line]] missions.
