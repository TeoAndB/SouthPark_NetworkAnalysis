"{{South Park character\n|name = Dr. Jonathan Katz\n|image = DJK.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Black; Balding\n|died = \"[[Summer Sucks]]\"\n|job = Professional Therapist\n|voice = Jonathan Katz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705967/|title=\"South Park\" Summer Sucks (TV episode 1998)|publisher=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Summer Sucks]]\"\n}}\n'''Dr. Jonathan Katz''' is the main character of the [[Comedy Central]] series ''Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist''. He appeared in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Summer Sucks]]\", where he is seen giving psychotherapy to [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], who was vacationing in New York. Dr. Katz believed that Mr. Hat was a manifestation of Mr. Garrison's homosexuality, which angered Mr. Garrison. Immediately afterwards, a gigantic charcoal snake destroyed part of New York, which also cut a swath of destruction through Dr. Katz's office, smothering him to death. Mr. Garrison, who shielded himself from the charcoal snake and emerged unscathed, felt that Dr. Katz deserved such a fate for his remarks about himself and Mr. Hat.\n\n==Appearance==\nDr. Katz wears a yellow button-up shirt and a red tie. He is mostly bald with black hair on the sides and back of his head. He has black eyebrows.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The outlines of Dr. Katz are squiggly, referencing the \"Squigglevision\" animation style of the show.\n* Coincidentally, a few months after \"Summer Sucks\" aired, MAD Magazine did a simultaneous parody in which Katz, along with his son Ben and assistant Laura, who is also Ben's girlfriend, moved to South Park and set up a practice in town. Unfortunately, the trials of working and living in South Park, having to listen to head cases like [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] (whose file contains over 450 folders) and Mr. Garrison, while Ben catches Laura in bed with [[Chef]], quickly leave him questioning his decision, and after a broken pencil starts a chain reaction in which [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is decapitated by his framed diploma, he calls his New York clients begging them to take him back.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n[[zh:卡茨医生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters]]"
