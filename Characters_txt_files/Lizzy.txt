However, Lizzy's mouth can be seen. Her parka has gray fleece padding and buttons up. She also wears gray gloves, dark gray pants, and black shoes. To date, her hair has never been shown onscreen.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Lizzy\">\nSPW pic -- Lizzy4.jpg|Lizzy insulting [[the boys]] in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\".\nSPW pic -- Lizzy9.jpg|Lizzy being carried in the mouth of a bear.\nLizzy2.png|Lizzy seen in \"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nLizzy seems to be very stubborn and competitive, as she challenges the boys without hesitation when they do not hand over the sleds, exhibiting confidence in her team's ability to win a sledding competition against them. She enjoys taunting the boys and coming up with creative insults, such as \"Butt Pirates\", \"Rump Rangers\" and \"Donut Pinchers\". She rubs in their faces when they lose [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] as a fellow sledder and reminds them of the upcoming competition, including calling them on a home phone to harass them. Her sexually advanced vocabulary also suggests a vulgar sense of humor uncommon among female characters in the show.\n\n==Interactions==\nLizzy was depicted alongside [[Bebe Stevens]], [[Sally Turner]], and [[Esther]] in her speaking appearance, where the three girls made up the members of her sledding team; they were also seen at her house when she called the boys up to taunt them.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her name is never spoken onscreen; the official script identifies her as \"LIZZY, a cute little girl in a pink coat\", which has been reinforced at the official website in the FAQ section and on Twitter.<ref>https://twitter.com/southpark/status/351423144650739712</ref>\n*Despite the fact she was carried offscreen by a bear at the end of \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\", she has been shown in later episodes. It is possible that the bear did not kill her, much like the bear in \"[[Jewbilee]]\".\n*Lizzy wears a parka and has a sexually advanced vocabulary, making her similar to [[Kenny McCormick]].\n*In the episode \"[[Douche and Turd]]\", there is another student identical to Lizzy sitting a few rows behind her in the audience at the school pep rally.\n*Since a number of new background fourth graders were created for the second half of the twelfth season, she has not reappeared on the show.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" - Seen on the [[South Park Elementary Playground|playground]], and later talks to [[Pip Pirrip]] at the dance.\n* \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\" - Seen singing in the choir.\n*\"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\" - She is a part of the girls sledding team.
