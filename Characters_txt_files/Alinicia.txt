They want to put on a play as spectacular as possible, and decide to being in a turkey that can do tricks to fit with the Thanksgiving theme. [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] brings in [[Gobbles]], a disabled turkey, which the kids feel is useless to them. The animal trainer [[Lamond]] brings in Alinicia to replace Gobbles. Timmy refuses to leave Gobbles out of the play but Alinicia refuses to perform with another turkey. She gets very upset, throws a fit and refuses to come out of the dressing room. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] does not know what to do, so Lamond tells him to kill Gobbles in an \"unfortunate accident\". However Cartman accidentally gets [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] killed instead.\n\nLamond tricks Timmy into letting Gobbles go into the wild by telling him that an animal shelter would take Gobbles away if he keeps it.

When he returns, he gets his revenge by ordering [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and his hunting buddies to shoot Alinicia. She is riddled with bullets and her blood spurts over a horrified Lamond. Cartman is horrified as Alinicia is just about to be up for the finale where she is to jump through a ring of fire. Instead, Gobbles takes her place, successfully stepping through the ring of fire on stage.\n\n==Appearance==\nAlinicia was a turkey with brown, white, and tan feathers.
