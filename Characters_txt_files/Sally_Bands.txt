She wears blue pants and a pink shirt.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Sally Bands\">\nTrapperKeeper027.png|Sally with presidential candidate [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]].\nTrapperKeeper050.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nShe appeared to be very articulate and driven, appearing incredibly motivated on ensuring Ike's presidency. Among other measures, she called for a re-evaluation of the votes after [[Filmore Anderson]] was declared president, on the grounds that the ballots were misleading and many kids did not know whom they were voting for.\n\nEventually, however, she got bored of the game and decided she would rather fingerpaint.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nShe appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as one of the six kindergarteners who hides in Hide 'n' Seek.
