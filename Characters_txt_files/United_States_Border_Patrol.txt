As more and more Mexicans leave, the Border Patrol is tasked with keeping Mexicans in the U.S. instead of keeping them out. USBP even starts recruiting volunteers but with minimal effect.\n\nVolunteer 5 is seen in the episode \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\" as one of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] supporters near Niagara Falls.\n{{Clear}}\n==Appearance==\n===Army Green Uniform===\n*Worn by most officers of the Border Patrol, it includes black shoes, army green pants, and a shirt with short or long sleeves with CBP (Customs and Border Protection) patch on the right sleeve and circular legacy Border Patrol patch on the left sleeve.
