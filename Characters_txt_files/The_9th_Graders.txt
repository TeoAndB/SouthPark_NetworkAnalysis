They were seen reading magazines/books with him, and then they helped Scott make the chili with pubes for [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. They appeared in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" along with [[Scott Tenorman]].\n\n==Appearance==\nThe ninth graders appear much taller than [[The 4th Grade|the fourth graders]], however, they are slightly shorter than the adults.\n\n===[[Scott Tenorman]]===\n{{main|Scott Tenorman}} \nScott Tenorman wears orange pants and a black shirt over a white long-sleeved shirt. He has a red fro, similar to [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s, orange eyebrows, and freckles. He is considered to be a ginger.\n\n[[Image:ScottTenormanMustDie22.gif|200px|thumb|The two other 9th Graders holding some pubes.]]\n===[[9th Grader with Purple Shirt|Brown Haired Teenager]]===\nThis kid wears black pants, a purple long-sleeved shirt, and a blue and gray beanie hat.

He has orange hair and orange eyebrows.\n\n==Personality==\nThey appear to be mischievous, and enjoy tormenting the younger kids, not by threats of physical violence like [[the 6th Graders]], but rather by outsmarting and deceiving them. One target in particular is [[Eric Cartman]], whom they trick into buying pubes by telling him that it would make him more mature in \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\". They later attempt to make him eat chilli laced with pubes, but this plan backfires massively.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - They help [[Scott Tenorman|Scott]] in his schemes to torment [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].\n*[[Asspen|\"Asspen\" ]] - Seen in the youth center.\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" - They appear along with [[the 6th Graders]] attempting to get [[Back Door Sluts 9|the porno]] from [[The Boys|the boys]].\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:九年级生]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Teens]]"
