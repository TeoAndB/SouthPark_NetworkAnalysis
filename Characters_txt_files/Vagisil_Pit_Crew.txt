They appear in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode \"[[Poor and Stupid]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCartman is set to race against several other NASCAR drivers, using his own vehicle sponsored by [[Vagisil]]. When the cue to start engines was called, Cartman asks what \"start your engines\" mean, with the lead crewman frustratingly pointing out the instructions.\n\nWhen Cartman decides to go full speed on the pace lap, the lead crewman interrupts once again, asking Cartman not to do so.\n\nThe crewmen could only watch more of Cartman's antics, which eventually led to all other drivers crashing out of the race.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:卫姿丝赛车维修队]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]"
