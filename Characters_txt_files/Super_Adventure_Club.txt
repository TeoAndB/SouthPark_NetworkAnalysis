The club travels the world in order to molest the native children of the countries they visit.\n\n==Background==\nThe group was founded by [[William P. Phineas]] who was an explorer. Unfortunately, wherever he went he was always beaten by somebody else who had reached there first. He decided that if he couldn't be the first person to reach a place, then he could be the first to molest the native children. As he molested children, he discovered tiny things in children's bodies, called \"marlocks\", which would enter his body and provide him with \"immortality\" \"''so sayeth the ruler of Benthos''\", a mysterious monster only mentioned during the explanation. Phineas was hit by a train in 1892 which killed him, despite his \"immortality\".\n\nThe group is often confused with the Adventure Club. The difference is that that Adventure Club does not molest any children and only the Super Adventure club does.\n\n[[File:TheReturnofChef102.png|thumb|left|William P. Phineas, the club's founder with several Aborigine children.]]\nDespite appearing primitive and old fashioned, they actually have a good understanding of modern technology, which is seen when they resurrect [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]] at the end of \"[[The Return of Chef]]\".\n\nThe club only appeared in \"[[The Return of Chef]]\" which featured the boys trying to turn Chef back to normal after he continued saying suggestive, pedophiliac things which had led to a [[Detective Jarvis|police]] inquest at [[South Park Elementary]]. The boys discovered the club's ways and tried to undo the brainwashing that had been done to Chef. They succeeded, but the club found Chef again and hit him with a tranquilizer dart. Upon recapturing him, they made him choose whether he should return to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] or remain with the club. He chose the latter but was killed when the bridge he was standing on was struck by lightning, leading to several injuries. The club managed to salvage his remains and resurrect him as Darth Chef.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n\n[[zh:超级冒险俱乐部]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Pedophillic organizations]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Immortals]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
