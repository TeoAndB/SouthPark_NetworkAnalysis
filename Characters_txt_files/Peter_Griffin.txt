He appears in the [[Season Ten]] episodes \"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" and \"[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nPeter appears in ''South Park's'' version of ''Family Guy's'' art style. He is an overweight man with short cut brown hair and a big head which has become one with his neck. He has big, round eyes and a round nose, and a big mouth. His chin has a very large and deep cleft in it, making the rest of his chin very big and rounded. He wears glasses which are very thin and are the exact same shape and size as his eyeballs. He wears a white buttoned shirt with a collar and slightly rolled up sleeves and a blue tie. He also has gray pants and a black belt with a golden buckle and has dark brown shoes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Peter Griffin\">\nPeter Griffin.png|Artwork of Peter Griffin on ''Family Guy''.\nCartoonWarsI022.png|Peter in \"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\".\nCartoonWarsI028.png|Peter and [[Muhammad]] buying tea from [[Mr. T]].\nGaryxPeter.png|Peter on a date with [[Gary Coleman]] in [[Mexico]].\nPeterGriffinDavidHasslehoff.png|Peter \"Auditioning to be [[David Hasselhoff]]'s car.\nPeterSalmonHelmet.png|Peter receiving a Salmon Helmet by Muhammad while wearing a toga.\nFGNews.png|An image of Family Guy staring Peter being broadcast on the news.\nPeterSPancakes.png|Peter selling pancakes to [[William Shatner]] wearing an outfit which resembles Capt.

On ''South Park'', he is portrayed similarly, but may be somewhat more of a slacker who gets involved in foolish and nonsensical acts, mainly parodying Family Guy's infamous cutaway gags.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" - Appears on the ''Family Guy'' show.\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]\"\n*\"[[Canada on Strike]]\" - Briefly shows up on the ''Family Guy'' show representing American comedy.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Unlike his appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'', Peter has black pants in ''[[South Park]]'' while in ''Family Guy'' his pants are green, nor does he have a tie in ''Family Guy''.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[familyguy:Peter Griffin|Peter Griffin on the Family Guy Wiki.]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n[[fr:Peter Griffin]]\n[[zh:彼得·格里芬]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrity voice actors]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]"
