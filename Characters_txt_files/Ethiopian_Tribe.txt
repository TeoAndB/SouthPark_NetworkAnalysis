They appear in two episodes; \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" in [[Season One]], \"[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]\" in [[Season Three]], and \"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" in [[Season Twelve]].\n\n==Background==\n===\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\"===\nWhile watching a commercial about widespread hunger in Ethiopia, [[The Boys|the boys]] donate to the cause with the hopes of receiving a Taiko Sport watch as a reward. Instead of the watch, a young Ethiopian boy is accidentally sent to them.\n\nHaving adopted the child, as a group, the boys take turns caring for him. They name him '[[Starvin' Marvin (Character)|Starvin' Marvin]]' and take him to [[South Park Elementary|school]]. [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] realizes the mistake and calls the authorities so Marvin can be sent back to Africa.\n\nLooking for Marvin, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]] arrives at [[Eric Cartman]]'s [[Cartman Residence|home]] in hopes of retrieving the child. Not wanting to return to Africa, Marvin advises the F.B.I. that Cartman is the Ethiopian child they are looking for, causing him to be sent to Africa in Marvin's place.\n\nUpon arriving in Africa, Cartman begins to feel extremely hungry, patronizing the tribe for food. He then notices a small structure in the distance and finds [[Sally Struthers]] inside it, hoarding food. After this has been revealed to the Ethiopian tribe, she is then tied up with an apple in her mouth.\n\nBack in the [[United States]], the mistake is realized and Starvin' Marvin is promptly returned to his tribe in Africa with an abundance of [[Mutant Turkeys|turkeys]].\n\n===\"[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]\"===\nAfter an alien spacecraft lands in Africa, near the Ethiopian tribe, [[Marklar|the alien]] disembarks his vessel, however, is soon eaten by a lion. Still annoyed by the [[Sister Hollis|Christian missionaries]] plaguing his tribe, Starvin' Marvin discovers the pilot-less ship and enters it.\n\nMarvin pilots the ship, into space, in search of a better place to live for his parents, his tribe, and himself. Upon hearing of this atrocity, the F.B.I. enlists Sally Struthers to help capture the stolen vessel.\n\nAfter a long space battle between Starvin' Marvin, the F.B.I., and the [[CBC Network]], all parties arrive on the planet called [[Marklar (Planet)|Marklar]], deemed to be a paradise by the Ethiopian tribe. The F.B.I. and the missionaries return to Earth, with the boys, and leave the tribe to settle on Marklar undisturbed.\n\n===\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\"===\nThough not the same tribe, their character models are used here to represent a Nigerian tribe. A blond station wagon driver approaches them to inform them that the cure for AIDS has been discovered, and they only have to inject themselves with \"all [their] chash\", which is seen to change nothing for them.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[zh:埃塞俄比亚部落]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]"
