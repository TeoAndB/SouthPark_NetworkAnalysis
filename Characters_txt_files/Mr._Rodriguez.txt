He first appears in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, \"[[You're Not Yelping]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[You're Not Yelping]]\", [[Eric Cartman]] visits Nueva Familia claiming to be a food critic, while abusing his claim to receive large amounts of free food. Believing he is who he says he is, Mr. Rodriguez goes out of his way to ensure Cartman is satisfied. Rodriguez runs into the kitchen in a panic and asks his wife to rush two taco orders for Cartman, who then promptly demands free dessert for the 5-star review.\n\nWhen he returns with the desserts, flan and an ice cream dish, he scolds [[David Rodriguez|David]] for arguing with Cartman. Two additional yelp critics arrive, and he rushes to provide them the same over-the-top treatment.\n\nAfter [[Whistlin' Willy's]] stands up to [[Gerald Broflovski]]'s antics as a yelp critic, Rodriguez becomes excited when [[Tuong Lu Kim]] suggests he do the same as well. Unfortunately, this was short-lived as the yelp critics fought back against Whistlin' Willy's. Rodriguez and his wife had decided to shut down the restaurant.\n\nNot wanting to see his family's restaurant shut down, David calls out Cartman, and inadvertently ''all'' of the yelp critics. He then comes up with a plan to save it, as outlined in \"[[The Yelper Special]]\". Following that, Mr. Rodriguez prepares a \"special\" burrito for Cartman, filled with \"home-made\" cream sauce.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Rodriguez wears black work shoes, black pants, and a plain brown shirt. He has black hair and no facial hair.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mr. Rodriguez\">\nDavidsParents1.png|Davids parents frantically trying to keep Cartman happy.\nDavidsParents2.png|Davids parents happy they can ignore yelp critics.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[You're Not Yelping]]\" - Seen working at her family restaurant, [[Nueva Familia]].\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - Seen with his family at the new [[Whole Foods Market]].\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" - Seen at [[Jimbo's Guns]]；later seen in the crowd of people standing in front of Whole Foods Market.\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Shots|Shots!!!]]\" - Seen at the PTA meeting.\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Seen with the other parents in front of [[South Park Elementary]] after [[Token Black|Token]] was taken to the hospital.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He uses the same model as a Mexican redneck that appeared in the episodes \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\", \"[[Cock Magic]]\", and \"[[W.T.F.]]\" The only difference is that the redneck wore a light green shirt instead of brown.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n[[zh:罗德里格斯先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
