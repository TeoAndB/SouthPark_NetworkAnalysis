But as the years went by, the Catholic Church deemed the idea of a rabbit running for Pope to be a form of sacrilege so they portrayed Saint Peter as a man and buried the truth.\n\nSaint Peter whose true form is that of a rabbit is the secret leader of [[Hare Club for Men]] and a rival of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] as seen in \"[[Fantastic Easter Special]]\".\n\nSaint Peter is also mentioned in the song \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\".\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Religious Figures]]\n[[Category:Religious characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]"
