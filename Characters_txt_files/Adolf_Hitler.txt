He is notable in ''[[South Park]]'' for being among the idols of [[Eric Cartman]], who tries to emulate his strong speaking style as well as his efforts to exterminate the Jewish people. He first appears briefly in the [[Season One]] episode \"[[Pinkeye]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhen Cartman is suggesting he will be famous in \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\", [[Wendy Testaburger]] makes a brief, but degrading, comment that Hitler was famous as well.\n\nIn \"[[Pinkeye]]\", Cartman dresses as Hitler for Halloween, with a costume made by [[Liane Cartman|his mother]]. He wasn't aware of Hitler's real self until [[Principal Victoria]] showed him a video of Hitler, during which he begins emulating his speech patterns, beginning his idolization that later became a focal point of his characterization in later seasons.\n\nHitler next appeared as a resident of Hell in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', harassing [[Kenny McCormick]] upon his entrance. He appears similarly in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\", sadly singing \"[[O Tannenbaum]]\" and lamenting his love of Christmas, resulting in [[Satan]] throwing a Christmas party in Hell and giving Hitler a Christmas tree of his own. He can still be seen there briefly in \"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]\".\n\nHe does not appear in \"[[The Passion of the Jew]]\"; however, Cartman dresses like him when he leads his followers on a march through the streets of the town.\n\nHitler briefly appears dressed as the \"Can You Hear Me Now?\" Verizon spokesperson at Satan's party in the episode \"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]\", getting in the way of Satan's big arrival. Unlike many of his earlier appearances, in which his head was a photo of the real Hitler, he is completely animated in this episode.\n\n==Appearance==\nHitler is was shown in a black suit in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\". In \"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]\", he was shown in a Halloween costume wearing glasses, light gray pants, and a dark gray jacket with South Park's version of the Verizon logo in the left shoulder area.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" - He is mentioned by Wendy in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - Principal Victoria shows Cartman a tape featuring him.\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] meets him in Hell.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\" - Sings \"[[O Tannenbaum]]\".\n*\"[[Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]\" - He attends Satan's Halloween party.\n*\"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\" - Mentioned by Cartman.\n*''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' - The Nazi zombies are voiced by Hitler's speeches.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - He is mentioned by [[PC Principal]].\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\" - Mentioned by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Adolf Hitler\">\nhitler small.jpg|Hitler, as seen in an educational video in \"[[Pinkeye]]\"\nHellhitler.JPG|Hitler in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''\nHitler2.JPG|Hitler in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\"\nHitler3.JPG|Hitler in \"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In many of his earlier appearances, he was depicted with a real picture of him pasted on a body. This was later changed in \"[[Hell on Earth 2006]]\", where he is given a typical ''South Park'' style face.\n**However, in \"[[Pinkeye]]\", the video [[Principal Victoria]] shows to Cartman portrays him with a circular, animated head as opposed to a photographic head, making him closely resemble [[Bob Johnson]].\n*His mother, introduced in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\", bears a striking resemblance to [[Sarah Valmer]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n[[es:Adolfo Hitler]]\n[[fr:Adolf Hitler]]\n[[ja:アドルフ・ヒトラー]]\n[[ru:Адольф Гитлер]]\n[[zh:阿道夫·希特勒]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Realistic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Military personalities]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Anti-Semitic characters]]\n[[Category:Historical celebrities]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Criminal celebrities]]"
