Marvin Marsh also sees Death and, while Death chases Kenny and the boys, Grandpa Marsh gives chase to Death as well, demanding his own death. The boys are saved when Death is distracted by an episode of [[Terrance and Phillip]], of which he appears to be a fan of, on a TV display in a downtown shop window, but just then the adults are successful in removing Terrance and Phillip from air and Death proceeds to kill Kenny. Death then shows Marvin Marsh his own grandfather who is now in eternal limbo. Death then disappears, along with [[Great-Great-Grandpa Marsh]] and Kenny.\n\nIn the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\", the exact same moment is shown in Kenny's flashback, but instead Kenny is shown killing Death by jumping on him while all of Death's bones come out of the robe and ice cream cones are released from his body.\n\nDeath appears in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', who was summoned by [[Princess Kenny|Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny]] against [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] before he transforms into [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] before being swept away by his Chaos Blast finisher.\n\nDeath returns in the series starting with \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\", where he shows the deceased loved ones died of COVID-19 and sees [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] hospitalized at the [[Hell's Pass Hospital]] before being treated by [[Randy Marsh|Randy's]] Pandemic Special weed. He appears on a tricycle like in \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\", looking out for the boys during the pandemic.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Death.jpg|thumb|left|Icon on South Park Studios.]]\nDeath is envisioned as a faceless character, presumably a skeleton, holding a wooden-handled sickle who communicates only in grunts. Death wears a dark-purple, full-body robe with a hood that obscures his face. His hood is shaped similar to his sickle.\n\n[[File:NaziZombieDeathSOT.jpeg|thumb|right|Nazi Zombie Death in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth''.]] In ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'', his appearance retains the same except he dons a Nazi armband on the left arm with a cap and holding a Nazi staff. Much like every Nazi Zombies in the game, he uses sound clips from Adolf Hitler's speech for this character when he got swept away by Professor Chaos.\n\nA different version of Death appears in ''South Park: The Fractured But Whole'', serving as an ultimate for Netherborn powers.\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nDeath demonstrates supernatural power, such as being able to kill Kenny with a single touch. When Death reveals itself, lightning and smoke precede its arrival.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Chases the boys in order to kill Kenny and shows Marvin Marsh his grandfather.\n*\"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" - Seen in Kenny's flashback; Kenny kills him by jumping on him in said flashback.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Cameos in on the crowd.\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Can be seen throughout South Park during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n\n[[es:Muerte (personaje)]]\n[[fr:Death (character)]]\n[[ja:死神]]\n[[zh:死神]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Immortals]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Demons]]"
