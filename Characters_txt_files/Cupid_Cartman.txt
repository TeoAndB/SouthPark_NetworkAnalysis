He first appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\", Cartman, who thinks black people belong together, plans to set up [[Token Black|Token]] and [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]] in a relationship, by having them locked alone in the school [[South Park Elementary Gymnasium|gymnasium]] overnight. After the two are rescued, Cartman secretly watches them, as they decide to pursue the relationship. At that time, Cupid Cartman appears next to Cartman and they congratulate each other.\n\nWhen Token and Nichole break up due to a misunderstanding, Cartman loses faith in Cupid Cartman and beats him with a bat. Later, after watching a laxative commercial, which suggests \"you have to push even harder\", he decides to apologize to Cupid Cartman and tries to get Token and Nichole back together again. After he succeeds in his plan, Cupid Cartman tells him he found a girl for him too. When asked who she was, Cupid Cartman points to [[Stacy Muleburg]], the ''Halitosis Kidz!'' kid, much to Cartman's horror.\n\nIn \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", Cartman attempts to use Cupid Cartman to bring [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] together. Cupid Cartman goes to Craig and shoots him with an arrow, as well as peeing in his mouth. Afterwards, Cupid Cartman attempts to flirt with Cartman, who denies his advances because he isn't gay.\n\nLate in the episode, when Tweek and Craig \"break up\", Cartman asks Cupid Cartman to make things right again, but he refuses to do so unless Cartman goes on a date with him. Cartman reluctantly agrees and Cupid Cartman shoots Craig's [[Thomas Tucker|dad]] with an arrow (and pees in his mouth) to get him to accept Craig's \"situation\". At the end of the episode, Cupid Cartman gives Cartman a massage on their date, which Cartman doesn't enjoy. He follows this by having anal sex with Cartman. This all happens in Cartman's imagination, though, as in the next scene it is revealed he is actually masturbating in the bathroom, as [[Liane Cartman|his mother]] watches.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is the Cupid version of Cartman. His hair is the same color as him, but it is curly, unlike Cartman's straight hair. He is nude with wings on his back and armed with a bow and a quiver of arrows. He also has pink cheeks.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Cupid Cartman\">\nCartmanFindsLove052.png|Cupid Cartman and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]\nCartmanFindsLove061.png|Cupid Cartman gets beaten by Cartman\nCartmanFindsLove070.png|Cupid Cartman injured after being beaten\nCartmanFindsLove096.png|Cupid Cartman and Eric Cartman at the [[Ruffian's]] Gay Bar\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nCupid Cartman is always seen with a smile and giggles quite often, especially when tickled by Cartman, which he expresses with his distinctive \"teehee!\" laugh. Cupid Cartman can only be seen and heard by Cartman, as [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] get confused when they see Cartman communicating with him. Cartman speaks to him as if he is a real person, even complaining about the odor he leaves in the bathroom (as well as chasing him, telling him to \"Come back and flush the toilet\") after using the toilet.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"A place for everything and everything in its place.\" - \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\"\n*\"Teeheehee!\" -\"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\"\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nAlthough he does not make a physical appearance, his name can be seen as part of Doctor Timothy's franchise plan.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" - Helps Cartman get Token and Nichole to date. Cartman beats him severely with a baseball bat. He makes Stacy Muleburg, the poster child for \"Halitosis Kidz!\", fall in love with Cartman.\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" - Helps Cartman get Craig, and Tweek back together. Shoots Craig and his dad with arrows, and subsequently pees in their mouths. Flirts with Cartman, and proceeds to \"have\" anal sex with him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He bears some resemblance to [[Elvin Cartman]], Eric's cousin.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n[[es:Yo Cupido]]\n[[fr:Cupid Cartman]]\n[[pl:Kupidynowy Ja]]\n[[zh:丘比特曼]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Made-up characters]]"
