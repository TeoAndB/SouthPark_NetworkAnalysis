Nobody in the audience noticed the substitution.\n\nIn the episode, \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", Mick Fleetwood can be seen playing drums in [[Randy Marsh]]'s band.\n\nThe Fleetwood Mac song \"[[Landslide]]\" is played over the closing scenes of \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", which depict [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] and [[Randy Marsh]]'s divorce and the aftermath of [[Stan Marsh]]'s cynicism.\n\nThe song was later reprised in \"[[Ass Burgers]]\" under more optimistic circumstances as Sharon and Randy get back together.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The circumstances surrounding the writing of \"Landslide\" run parallel to the turmoil occurring during Stan's life in \"[[You're Getting Old]]\". Stevie Nicks wrote the song in Aspen, Colorado while contemplating the direction her life was taking at the time. The lyrical subject matter also touches upon the deterioration of her relationship with her long-time partner, Lindsey Buckingham (who plays lead guitar in the band).\n\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[zh:佛利伍麦克]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:British characters]]"
