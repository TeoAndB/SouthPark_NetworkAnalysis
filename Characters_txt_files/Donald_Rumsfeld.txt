He appears in \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\" and later in \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\", as a member of [[George Bush]]'s inner circle.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:ALaddertoHeaven084.png|thumb|left|Rumsfeld, standing alongside [[George W. Bush]], [[Dick Cheney]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]] in \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\"]]\nIn both of his appearances, he wears a blue suit with a white shirt and a red tie. He is animated differently in both of his appearances so consequentially the colors of his clothes are slightly lighter in \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\". In both cases, he is animated with black wavy hair with gray highlights, gray eyebrows and wrinkles on his face and neck. He also wears black glasses with round, gray frames.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\"\n*\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\"\n\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n\n[[fr:Donald Rumsfeld]]\n[[pl:Donald Rumsfeld]]\n[[zh:唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
