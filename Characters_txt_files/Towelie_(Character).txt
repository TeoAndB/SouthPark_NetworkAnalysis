He first appeared in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[Towelie]]\".\n\nHe is usually seen either appearing out of nowhere to give towel advice to the [[City people|citizens]] of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] or getting high. The theme song from [[Popeye]] plays whenever Towelie gets high.\n\n==Background==\nTowelie is said to be 17 in towel years in \"[[Professor Chaos]]\", although how many actual years a \"towel year\" is worth is unknown. In \"[[Crippled Summer]]\", he had agreed to do an intervention. He also has been working at [[Lake Tardicaca]] and has been warned for getting high 14 times. His name (Spelled in Towelie) as TOWELYEY, though he was probably high at the time of spelling it so the legitimacy of this spelling is hard to confirm.\n\nTowelie was addicted to marijuana, crystal meth, and crack cocaine, and tried using heroin and inhaling computer duster. Towelie has been sober since April 26, 2010. However, in \"[[Tegridy Farms]]\", it is implied that he may be using marijuana again since he took a job at the Marsh family's hemp farm, which might be the result of the events of ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' which reference his rehab, but is seen getting high multiple times after his boss fight, where he is calmed by setting the store's weed stock on fire.\n\n===Reception===\nAlthough the creators of ''[[South Park]]'' intentionally made Towelie a terrible character, he gained a huge amount of popularity. After his [[Towelie|initial appearance]], he took on parts, usually cameos, in other episodes. In spite of this, he is regarded as \"the worst character ever\" by other characters within the show.\n\n==Appearance==\nTowelie is probably best described as an anthropomorphic light-blue towel with arms, legs, and a face. He wears tiny yellow shoes and speaks in a high-pitched voice with an apparent slight southern accent. His eyes become visibly bloodshot when he gets high. In \"[[Crippled Summer]]\", he is shown crumpled and burnt at the edges, due to his drug addiction.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Personality==\nTowelie clearly wants to get high at all times; he doesn't hesitate to get high in public and suggesting the kids and everyone to get high as well. He prefers smoking weed but often (as in \"Crippled Summer\") uses crack and/or meth and other drugs possibly. When he is not high he gets in an awful mood and can become rude. On such occasions where he is out of dope and money, he prostitutes himself to old men by providing oral sex in exchange for money in order to buy more drugs and get high again.\n\nDespite the fact he is an addict, he is genuinely a mild persona often exhibiting sensitivity and kindness. He seldom becomes aggressive and usually due to being out of dope, or when people throw away his dope either by accident or to protect him. Towelie is also, by nature, very caring of others. He saved the boys' lives in his debut and constantly reminds people to use towels after getting wet so as not to catch a cold. Towelie's love for his son was the driving force behind him getting clean. Furthermore, he also carries some moral standards such as when he called out Randy for his greed by pandering to the Chinese government, selling out to big businesses such as MedMen, and destroying people's homegrown weed.  \n\n==Family==\n[[File:Washcloth.png|thumb|left|Towelie's girlfriend, [[Rebecca (Towelie's Girlfriend)|Rebecca]], and his son, [[Washcloth]].]]\nTowelie is shown in the episode \"[[Crippled Summer]]\" to have a family. It consists of his girlfriend named [[Rebecca (Towelie's Girlfriend)|Rebecca]], whose face was blurred out, and their son together, named [[Washcloth]].\n\nRebecca kicked Towelie out for being a bad influence on their son, preventing him from speaking to Washcloth when he was high. The boys use Washcloth as an incentive to get Towelie to get treatment. Towelie, Rebecca, and Washcloth later moved back in together after Towelie kicked his addiction.\n\n{{clear}}\n==Quotes==\n*'''Towelie:''' \"You wanna get high?\" from \"[[Towelie]]\"\n*'''Towelie:''' \"That's my last joint, asshole!\" from \"[[Towelie]]\"\n*'''Towelie:''' \"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today?

The pair of shoes have Towelie's eyes on front of the tongues, changing colors when exposed to UV/sunlight making him look high. The back of the tongues contain a pocket and memorable quotes from the show: \"Don't Forget to Bring a Towel\" and \"I Have No Idea What's Going On\". They include two different keychains of Towelie.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Towelie]]\" - Towelie's debut appearance; he plays a major role in the episode.\n*\"[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]\" - Briefly advises [[the boys]] on the importance of always bringing a towel.\n*\"[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]\" - Appears in the newspaper.\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\" - Appears as a potential replacement for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].

[[The New Kid]] must get [[Classi]]'s prescription from him.\n\nHowever, Towelie has become easily enraged due to the loss of drugs, for a trivial reason, he engaged in combat with the New Kid and the Coon. After the kids managed to burn the weed piles in the store, Towelie calmed down and gave the kids what they wanted.\n\nTowelie can also be seen as an assistance provider in the [[Towelie: Your Gaming Bud]] downloadable content.\n\nAs shown in a trailer, Towelie could have had a role playing as a mage assisting the boys in their quest of locating a dark sorcerer. This was cut as it did not make it into the final production.\n\n{{TFBW Enemy Abilities\n|Name = Towelie\n|Image = Tb towlie.png\n|Health = Infinite\n|Move = 2\n|Immunities = All status effects\n|AbilityImage1 = Towelie power1.png\n|Ability1 = Thermite Bong\n|Description1 = Sprays an ignited aerosol onto his targets\n|RangeDesc1 = All targets on a three-tile line in front of Towelie\n|Range1 = Multilane.png\n|Effect1 = 16 Damage (Cas.)<br>32 Damage (Hero.)<br>40 Damage (Mast.)<br>56 Damage (Dia.)\n|Status1 = Burning\n}}\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nToweliegencard.png|'''[[Towelie (Phone Destroyer)|Towelie]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[de:Towelie]]\n[[es:Toallín]]\n[[it:Asciughino (Personaggio)]]\n[[ja:タオリー]]\n[[zh:毛巾巾]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Supporting characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]"
