He has a piece of celery as an arm and [[Patrick Duffy]] as a leg. He appears prominently in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Volcano]]\". He has had several cameo appearances since.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Volcano055.png|thumb|left|Cartman as Scuzzlebutt.]]\nIn \"[[Volcano]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tells the story of Scuzzlebutt to scare his friends, depicting him as a vicious monster, though they do not believe him. In order to scare them even more, Cartman dresses up as Scuzzlebutt. This plan failed and Cartman was almost shot.\n\nEventually, a volcano erupted and Cartman and the others were trapped, as the town built a trench to divert the lava away from the town. This is when Scuzzlebutt appears for real, much to Cartman's surprise, and weaves a wicker basket that saves the children. Shortly after, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] kills Scuzzlebutt to prove to his [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo]] that he is a good nephew, but that pretty much failed.\n\nIn \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\", in-keeping with the re-imagined versions of the flashback sequences in that episode, Scuzzlebutt instead weaves some ice cream and has Brent Musburger for a leg instead of Patrick Duffy.\n\nAt the end of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Scuzzlebutt is seen in the crowd on the right while everyone is singing the \"[[Mountain Town (Reprise)|Mountain Town reprise]]\" despite the fact that he was killed way before the [[American-Canadian War]].\n\n==Appearance==\nSkuzzlebutt is a large brown creature with Patrick Duffy as a leg and a celery stick for an arm. He has dark brown hair and a dark brown beard.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a kind, sweet-natured creature with a basic grasp of the English language, as he is shown able to say the words \"friend\" and \"Volcano\". He is reclusive but unafraid of humans. He is benevolent and thoughtful, as he is shown saving the boys in a wicker basket and giving some freshly-picked mountain flowers to [[Mayor McDaniels]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Scuzzlebutt\">\nScuzzlebutt.jpg|Scuzzlebutt on [[South Park Studios]]\nSkuzzlebutt.JPG|Scuzzlebutt holding a basket\nVolcano080.png|Scuzzlebutt saving [[The Boys]], Jimbo, and Ned.\nVolcano084.png|Scuzzlebutt giving flowers to [[Mayor McDaniels]].\nVolcano085.png|[[Stan Marsh|Stan]] kills Scuzzlebutt\nScuzzlebuttreturn.png|Scuzzlebutt in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\nScuzzlebuttintro.png|Scuzzlebutt in the Intro (Season 2)\nSPRScuzzlebutt.png|Scuzzlebutt as Playable Character in ''[[South Park Rally]]''.\nScuzzlebutt01.jpg|Scuzzlebutt on ''[[South Park: Chef's Luv Shack]]''.\nScuzzlebuttSOTPausescreen.jpeg|Scuzzlebutt on ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' during his very rare appearance in the pause screen.\nHermes Kenny.png|Scuzzlebutt as he appears in the Hermes Kenny's card art on ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''\nSouthPark10TheGameScuzzlebutt.jpg|Scuzzlebutt in South Park 10: The Game.\n87692.png|Scuzzlebutt as a boss in South Park (Unreleased GBC game)\nScuzzlebutt Full Art.jpg|Scuzzlebutt’s Card art\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In some early advertisements for the [[South Park (Video Game)|South Park video game]], it was revealed that there was originally going to be a level involving Scuzzlebutt as a boss, but the idea was scrapped.\n*Scuzzlebutt appears in the crowd at the end of the [[South Park Theme]].\n*Scuzzlebutt is in the game ''[[South Park Rally]]'', but not in the Nintendo 64 version.\n*Scuzzlebutt is a monster that was inspired by a real life legendary monster in Colorado.\n*In the Spanish version of Scuzzlebutt, Patrick Duffy was replaced by Ricky Martin.
