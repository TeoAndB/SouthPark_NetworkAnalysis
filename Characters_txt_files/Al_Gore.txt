He is most notable within the series for trying to alert people of [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]], though he also appears once during his vice presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.\n\n==Appearance==\nAl Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair.  In [[Season Ten]], his new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing a red cape. In [[Season Twenty-Two]], his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling shoes.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Al Gore}}\n\n==Personality==\nGore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents the [[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]] creature and puts [[The Boys|the boys]]' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, \"You just use ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!\". This indicates that Gore has an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking idée fixe has poisoned his mind to the point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.\n\nGore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the world would consider him a hero for \"destroying\" it, which is all he cares about. His mental creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\" where it goes on a rampage in South Park.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[The Boys]]===\nStan forced the rest of the boys to help Al Gore search for ManBearPig. While the rest of the boys did not care how Al Gore felt, Stan pitied him, leading to Al Gore taking them and then abandoning them in the [[Cave of the Winds]], nearly killing them by causing a cave-in and flooded the place, all in order to finally be rid of ManBearPig.  Because of this, all four boys now dislike him. When he gave a speech for the boys at their \"memorial\" at the Cave, he did not even know their names, and just referred to them as \"Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and Kid 4\". Infuriated with his delusions that almost got them killed, Stan yelled at him, calling him a \"loser\".\n\n==Quotes==\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"I'm super cereal!\"\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"No stupid, it's ManBearPig!\"\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"I'm off! Whooooshh.\"\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"This looks like ManBearPig central.\"\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"Excelsior!\"\n*'''Al Gore: '''\"ManBearPig, half-man, half-bear, half-pig\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[ManBearPig (Character)|ManBearPig]]'s \"existence\" in [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]] is possibly the result of everyone in South Park believing that Al Gore made him up.\n*In the episode \"[[ManBearPig]]\", Al Gore describes ManBearPig as \"half-man, half bear, half pig\", which is mathematically impossible as a being cannot be composed of three halves, and must be thirds.\n*He often uses the phrase \"I'm super-duper cereal\", a parody of an incident while on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' where in response to a question about breakfast cereal, he responded ''Dallas'', believing she meant TV serial.\n*Al Gore speaks with a strong effeminate accent.\n*In \"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\", he appears to have black hair, but in \"ManBearPig\" he has brown hair and in \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\", grey hair.\n*The actual Al Gore has said in an interview with [[wikipedia:Trevor Noah|Trevor Noah ]]on ''[[wikipedia:The Daily Show|The Daily Show]]'' that he was impressed with [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] with his portrayal, and that he appreciated the episode a lot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG-Cp1y0UO8|title=Al Gore's interview with Trevor Noah on ''The Daily Show''}}</ref>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\" - Debut appearance; is seen in the [[White House]] for a few brief seconds, saying he is glad he does not have [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]'s job. He looks completely different than he does in the other episodes, and the only way to tell it is him is his voice and him being beside the president.\n*\"[[ManBearPig]]\" - Appears at [[South Park Elementary]] to raise awareness about ManBearPig, with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] befriending him. He takes the boys to the Cave of the Winds, nearly killing them.\n*\"[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]\" - Angry over ManBearPig escaping in the previous episode, still believing him to be real. He later nukes Imaginationland, killing everyone temporarily.\n*\"[[Britney's New Look]]\"\n*\"[[200]]\" - No lines, but appears with other celebrities to sue the town and gain goo so they cannot be made fun of.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Same as above.\n*\"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\" - Helps the boys find information about ManBearPig.\n*\"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\"\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end, celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n===Video Games===\n====''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''====\nAl Gore appears behind a tree next to the Bijou Theater, where he asks Douchebag to put out ManBearPig trackers in various places. After that, he spams your page with status updates, he comes to the conclusion that Douchebag is ManBearPig himself and you must fight him to unfriend him. His first attack is using a slideshow presentation to make your character sleepy, and he summons bodyguards to protect him. After he is beaten, he starts terrorizing the church as ManBearPig. After you beat him, he can be found lying unconscious at the church. At the end of the game, after Douchebag leaves the scene, he reappears as ManBearPig hiding behind the tree.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n\n<!--Interwiki links-->\n[[de:Al Gore]]\n[[es:Al Gore]]\n[[fr:Al Gore]]\n[[it:Al Gore]]\n[[ja:アル・ゴア]]\n[[zh:阿尔·戈尔]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]"
