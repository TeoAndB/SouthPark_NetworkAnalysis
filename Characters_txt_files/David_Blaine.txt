His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand.\n\nHe is the leader of the suicide cult religion, \"Blaintology\" who views his magic tricks as holy \"miracles\". He considers himself God, but the Super Best Friends halt the suicides and destroy Blaine's giant [[Abraham Lincoln]] statue with their own giant [[John Wilkes Booth]] statue. Blaine escapes with a jet.\n\nBlaine appears again in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\", as a member of [[Christopher Reeve|Christopher Reeve's]] [[Legion of Doom]]. His most recent appearance was in the episode \"[[201]]\", as one of the celebrities who is suing South Park.\n\n==Appearance==\nDavid Blaine has short black hair and his facial hair is growing in. When doing street magic, he wears black pants, a black long-sleeve shirt, and black shoes. When acting as the leader of his religion he wears a white t-shirt which buttons up and has a collar.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of David Blaine\">\nKimjongblaine.JPG_HD.png|David Blaine, with Cheetah and [[Kim Jong-il]] in \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\".\nshot0010.png|Pick a card.\nDavidBlaine201 .png|Blaine in \"[[201]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nBlaine is an evil, diabolical and power-hungry individual, who revels in the dark arts and manipulates gullible individuals into following his suicidal death cult. He has a callous and cruel disregard regard for the lives of his members, who he is willing to sacrifice on a mass scale, in order for him to take over the world as a supervillain. He is also extremely narcissistic and suffers from a God-complex, believing his magic tricks and spells to be \"holy miracles\" and envisions himself as a messiah of sorts.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Super Best Friends]]\" - Rivals Jesus with his own impressive religious cult following.\n*\"[[Krazy Kripples]]\" - Appears as a member of Christopher Reeve's [[Legion of Doom]].\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen among the audience singing the reprise of \"[[Bleeding Heart Rock Protest Song vs. Pro War Country Song]]\".\n*\"[[200]]\" - Appears at Tom Cruise house with all celebrities suing South Park.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Appears as one of the celebrities suing South Park.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[es:David Blaine]]\n[[fr:David Blaine]]\n[[ja:デビッド・ブレイン]]\n[[zh:大卫·布莱恩]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Religious Figures]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
