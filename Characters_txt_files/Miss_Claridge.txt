The fire was started when [[The Boys|the boys]] wanted to play \"fireman\" and asked the \"baddest kid in pre-school\", [[Trent Boyett]], to start a fire for them. In spite of the boys' efforts to extinguish the fire (by urinating on it), the fire grew out of control and nearly killed Miss Claridge. Miss Claridge survived but was badly injured and placed on a modern chair which very much resembles that of Capt. Christopher Pike in the original ''Star Trek'' episode \"The Menagerie\". She cannot speak, and can only communicate by activating the lights and beeps in her wheelchair. If it lights and beeps once it means \"yes\" and twice means \"no.\" It is not clear how she can function as a teacher if she can only communicate \"yes\" and \"no.\"\n\nThe boys denied all culpability for the fire, resulting in Trent Boyett being sent to Juvenile Hall for 5 years. One day, Miss Claridge's wheelchair ran out of power in the middle of the road where the boys found her. Seeking to escape Trent Boyett who has been released from Juvenile Hall, they appeal to Stan's older sister [[Shelly Marsh]] for protection. Shelly agrees, but only if the boys confess to Miss Claridge their role in the fire. As the boys start to confess to her, Trent Boyett arrives and confronts the boys. Cartman tries to stop him with his mother's taser gun but it accidentally shoots Miss Claridge. It overcharges her wheelchair which spins out of control and crashes into a propane shop which blows up and sets her on fire. After crashing into a pet shop and getting attacked by cats, she hits a fire hydrant putting the flames out. The police arrive and ask if Trent started the fire. She replies \"no\" with 2 beeps but the police mistake it for \"yes yes\" and arrest Trent. Miss Claridge appears briefly in 2 other episodes, \"[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\", where Cartman, in his efforts to atone for his life's misdeeds, gives her a fruit basket and \"[[Erection Day]]\" where she could be seen watching Jimmy perform his stand-up comedy.\n\nA new preschool teacher is seen in \"[[Member Berries]]\", suggesting she is no longer with the school.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe had long, light brown hair with a purple headband. She wore a pink shirt with a white shirt beneath, a purple dress with a flower on the left side, and a purple belt on the waist. She also wore gold earrings (similar to [[Mrs. Testaburger]]'s). After the fire, she is in her electric wheelchair which resembles Capt. Christopher Pike's wheelchair from the original ''Star Trek'' episode \"The Menagerie\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mrs. Claridge\">\nMs._Claridge.png|Ms. Claridge before the accident\n128a.jpg|Ms. Claridge on [[South Park Studios]].\nPreschool19.jpg|Ms. Claridge with [[Mr. Mackey]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eight}}\n[[es:Señorita Claridge]]\n[[zh:克拉里奇老师]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mona Marshall]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Former school faculty]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]"
