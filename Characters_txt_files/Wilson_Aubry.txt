The [[Coon and Friends]] visit him to help him, but he turns them down, believing that they did all the horrible things [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]] said they did on [[Facebook]].\n\n==Appearance==\nWilson is a chubby first-grader with brown hair styled into an undercut and freckles. He wears a sports jersey, army pants, and white socks.\n\n==Personality==\nWilson, like the rest of the town, blindly accepted Professor Chaos' Facebook posts as real 'news', implying he doesn't have much of a mind of his own, which [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]] accuses him of. He was dismissive when The Coon tried to tell him the posts were fake, instead screaming and slamming the door in his face.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-One}}\n[[zh:威尔逊·奥布里]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:1st graders]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
