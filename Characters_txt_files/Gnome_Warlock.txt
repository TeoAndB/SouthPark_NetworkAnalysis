"{{South Park character\n|name = Gnome Warlock\n|image = Local-creatures-gnome-warlock.png\n|race = Gnome\n|hair = Brown\n|appearance = ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''\n}}\nThe '''Gnome Warlock''' is a boss in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n==Appearance==\nUnlike other [[Underpants Gnomes]], the Gnome Warlock wears a skull hat and has several tattoos in his face and body. He carries a sling bag which contains gnome powder capable of shrinking anyone, and wields a pencil decorated with a bone and feather as staff.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\nIn [[Defeat the Underpants Gnomes]] quest, the Gnome Warlock first appeared after [[The New Kid]] has defeated the other [[Underpants Gnomes]] on the first round and eventually shrunk him. Later on, he is shown with some remaining gnomes in the parents' room stealing underpants. As soon as The New Kid defeats the gnomes for the last time, he chases after the Warlock to the parents' bed and battles. After the Warlock is defeated, he just simply gave The New Kid some Gnome Dust to regrow again and tries to explain that the gnomes are just trying to stop the Nazi Green Goo to spread around in the Gnome Underground World. But before he could finish, he gets crushed by the New Kid's mother's breasts.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Melee Attack''' - The warlock attacks the new kid with his pencil-staff.\n*'''Shrink Underwear''' - The warlock sneaks behind the New Kid and shrinks his underwear, inflicting ability down if not blocked.\n*'''Levitate''' - This attack is rare. He gives the New Kid a wedgie in a magical way and inflicts attack down if not blocked.\n*'''Hanging Low''' - This attack is not summoned by the Warlock, but from The New Kid's dad instead. This will summon the dad's balls to hit The New Kid and causes heavy damage if not dodged.\n[[zh:侏儒巫师]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Video Game Exclusive characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Enemies]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]"
