He appears throughout [[Season Seventeen]]'s Black Friday trilogy, in \"[[Black Friday]]\", \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\", and \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\".\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\nIn the game, Feldspar is a member of the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]] as one of the [[Grand Wizard King]]'s three bravest warriors (the others being [[Tweek Tweak]] the Barbarian and [[Token Black]] the Healer), serving as an elite thief. He is broken out of detention by [[The New Kid|Douchebag]], and from that point assists Kupa Keep in the battle of the Giggling Donkey. However, Feldspar ends up betraying Kupa Keep and joined [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde Donovan's]] [[Clyde's Army of Darkness|Army of Darkness]] as his lieutenant, on the grounds that Cartman had no authority following Clyde's theft of the [[Stick of Truth]]. He attempts to defend Clyde's base from an attack arranged by the alliance of the Grand Wizard and The High Elf but is defeated by Douchebag. He is not seen afterward.\n[[es:Feldespato el Ladrón]]\n[[zh:长石盗贼]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Bosses]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: KKK Members]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Enemies]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
