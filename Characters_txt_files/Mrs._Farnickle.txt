"{{South Park character\n|name = Mrs. Farnickle\n|image = Adults-mrs-farnickle.png\n|gender = Female\n|hair = Gray\n|job = Mall Clerk\n|religion = Roman Catholic\n|voice = [[Mona Marshall]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397941/|title=\"Margaritaville\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|relation1 = Husband\n|relativename1 = [[Mr. Farnickle]]\n|appearance = \"[[It Hits the Fan]]\"\n}}\n'''Mrs. Farnickle''' is a character that first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[It Hits the Fan]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[It Hits the Fan]]\", she is seen using the word \"shit\" nonchalantly with [[Mr. Farnickle|her husband]]. She later appears in the episode \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\". She asks [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] to help her cross the street, but Tweek is afraid to do it because he does not know her.\n\nShe is seen a few times at [[Farnickle Residence|her home]]. In \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\", she is seen again with her husband at home. She asks the boys to investigate what happened to her missing pie. In \"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] comes to her house to check for and exterminate [[hippies]].\n\nIn\" [[Margaritaville]]\", her name is revealed when the [[Benny|bank teller]] calls her Mrs. Farnickle. \n\nIn \"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\", an elderly woman who looks rather similar to her, [[Dotty Applegate]], buys a pistol from [[Jimbo's Guns]]. [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] wrongly addresses her as \"Mrs. Farnickle\". It is likely that the animators accidentally mistook Ms. Applegate's character model for Mrs. Farnickle.\n\n==Appearance==\nHer clothing differs in different episodes. In \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\", she wears teal pants, a purple shirt with red trimming, and black shoes. In \"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\", she has green pants on and her shirt is pink with red trimming. In \"[[Margaritaville]]\", she wears a teal skirt, pink slip-on shoes, and a pink shirt. She also holds a black handbag. In ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', she wears a purple shirt and teal pants.\n\nIn all of her appearances, she has white hair, has a light gray shirt under a long-sleeved one, and wears gold earrings. Her hairstyle is consistent with the exception of \"[[Margaritaville]]\" in which her hair is curled.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mrs. Farnickle\">\nLilCrimeStoppers016.png|Mrs. Farnickle with her husband at home in \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\".\nMargaritaville009.png|Mrs. Farnickle at the [[Bank of South Park|bank]] in \"[[Margaritaville]]\".\nSPHH50.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[It Hits the Fan]]\"\n*\"[[The Entity]]\" - Seen as one of the first people to use [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s [[IT|vehicle]].\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - Seen with her husband at [[Mabel Cartman]]'s funeral.\n*\"[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]\" - Seen at [[Shady Acres]] when the boys barge in to watch the [[Russell Crowe Fightin' Around The World|Russell Crowe show]].
