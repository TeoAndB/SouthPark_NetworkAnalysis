He says he's on the 5th grade in this episode.\n\nHe was seen along with the other 6th graders in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" to pick up a porn tape that the boys were carrying.\n\nHis last notable appearance was in \"[[Pre-School]]\" where he and the other 6th graders promise to defend the boys from being attacked by [[Trent Boyett]] if they bring a photo of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mother]]'s breasts. The boys then bring the photo (which was actually a photo of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ass), the 6th Graders then try to fight Trent Boyett but end up failing.\n\n==Personality==\nHis favorite hobbies are bullying the 4th graders and riding a bicycle, which he pretends to be a motorcycle. Like most other 6th graders, he doesn't seem to be very smart, as he thinks the photo the boys brought was really a photo of [[Sharon Marsh]]'s boobs. He seems to have stopped being a bully in recent episodes, as he is seen talking to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and two other 4th graders in \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\".\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Bartles]] and the [[6th Grader with Black Hair and Blue Shirt]]===\nHe was seen alongside these two 6th Graders in a few episodes. In the episode \"[[Fourth Grade]]\" the three are seen pushing [[The Boys|the boys]] together and in the episode \"[[About Last Night...]]\" they are seen firing fireworks. The three are also seen at the end of the episode \"[[Pre-School]]\", but with the [[6th Grader Leader]] together.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is a short 6th grader with short light brown hair and thin eyebrows. He wears a bright lime green long-sleeved V-neck shirt, gray pants and black shoes.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the 6th Grader with Green Shirt\" widths=\"160\">\n411 00002.jpg|He along with [[Bartles]] and the [[6th Grader with Black Hair and Blue Shirt]] talking to [[The Boys|the boys]].\nPreSchool46.png|He along with the other 6th graders seeing a fake photo of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s breasts.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Debut.\n*\"[[Fourth Grade]]\" - First speaking role.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Seen watching [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s video.\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - (Cameo)\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" - Seen with the other 6th graders.\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\" - Seen watching [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s presentation.\n*\"[[Pre-School]]\"\n*\"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" - Seen in the crowd at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - Seen in the school hallways.\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\"\n*\"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" - Watch the fight.\n*\"[[About Last Night...]]\" - Seen firing fireworks.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" - Seen in the gym.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen on Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen at the assembly.\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" - Seen talking to the 4th graders.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Seen watching [[Marcus Preston]]'s speech.\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\" - Seen on the playground.\n*\"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\" - Seen on the playground.\n*\"[[Bike Parade]]\" - Seen on the bike parade.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nAt the end of [[The Bowels of the Beast]] and [[The Hundred Hands of Chaos]], he is seen among the students walking out of school after dismissal.\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:绿衣六年级生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:6th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
