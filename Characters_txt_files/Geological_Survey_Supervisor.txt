In response, the supervisor fired him from his job the following day.\n\nIn \"[[The Cissy]]\", the supervisor appears to have re-hired Randy. He was pressured by Carol to create a separate bathroom for Randy (as Lorde), as many of the female geologists were not comfortable working with a transwoman, but Carol and the supervisor eventually agreed to let Lorde use the women's bathroom again.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe supervisor wears a green working suit with a black tie and black pants.\n\nDuring the street celebration following Obama's victory, he is seen wearing a grey Obama/Biden shirt over his working attire.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:地质调查局领导]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
