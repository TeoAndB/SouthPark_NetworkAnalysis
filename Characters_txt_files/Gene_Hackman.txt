Among other roles, he played Lex Luthor opposite [[Christopher Reeve]] as Superman in the ''Superman'' film series. He appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\".\n\n==Background==\nGene AKA \"Hack Man\" attempts to persuade [[Christopher Reeve]] to stop sucking baby fetus stem-cells, which he uses to cure his paralysis. However, Gene Hackman is not someone who delights in disabilities, commending that he wishes quadriplegia on no one and is pleased that Reeve was cured of it, but begs him to stop consuming fetuses as the concept is unnatural. Christopher becomes a supervillain and forms the [[Legion of Doom]], out of his resentment towards Hackman's protesting of stem-cells research. Hackman uses the public's support to get a law passed through the US Government to ban stem-cells so Christopher cannot get them anymore. Somehow, Christopher gets imprisoned in the \"Phantom Zone\" glass pane and sent into outer space like the supervillains from ''Superman II''.\n\n==Appearance==\nGene Hackman is a very elderly looking man with grey hair and a mustache. He dresses very simply, wearing a red shirt, brown pants, and a gray hat.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Krazy Kripples]]\" - He tries to tell Christopher Reeve to stop eating baby fetuses to cure his paralysis.
