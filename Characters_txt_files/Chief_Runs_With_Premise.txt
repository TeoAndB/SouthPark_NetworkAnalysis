He appears in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Red Man's Greed]]\".\n\n==Background==\nChief Runs With Premise is the main antagonist in the episode. He wants to buy and demolish [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] in order to build a superhighway straight from Denver to the casino. He eventually wins South Park from them while gambling, but later has a change of heart and gives the [[City People|townsfolk]] back their town.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is a greedy, unscrupulous corporate mogul who will stop at nothing to make more money. He does not care about hurting others to make his casino even bigger and richer; making people gamble their life savings away and trying to buy and demolish South Park.\n\nHe resorts to deception to get what he wants, not batting an eyelid while lying and hurting others. He gave the people of South Park blankets infected with [[S.A.R.S.]] under the pretext of charity.\n\n==Appearance==\nChief Runs With Premise wears a black two-piece suit with a white shirt and blue tie. Like the rest of the Native Americans, he has darker skin and black hair. His long hair is tied in a braid at the back. His head garment is similar to that of a traditional Plains Indian feathered headdress. It symbolizes authority which is representative of the fact that he owns the casino that bought South Park.\n\nAs a running gag in the episode, he and all the Native American characters laugh in unison to the rhythm of \"Ha ha ha ha!\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n\n[[fr:Chief Runs With Premise]]\n[[zh:带屋跑酋长]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
