She first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode \"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\", and made a cameo appearance in the [[Season Twenty]] episode, \"[[Oh, Jeez]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\", [[Herbert Garrison]] is in town visiting, and confronting some unfinished demons he has with his [[Herbert Garrison Sr.|father]]. Garrison believes that his father does not love him, because he never sexually abused him. His mother insists that is not the case, and tries to support her son. In the end, Mr. Garrison Senior and Mr. Garrison reconcile, much to the joy of Mrs. Garrison.\n\nShe and her husband make a brief cameo appearance in \"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" in a photograph at [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s home.\n\n==Appearance==\nMrs. Garrison is an elderly lady with shoulder-length, wavy, and receding hair that is the same steel gray as her son's. She wears a white, long-sleeved shirt with gold buttons and a baggy, purple cardigan with a v-neck. She tucks this into her dark blue skirt, which covers her knees. She wears white tights, pink lipstick, and small black-framed rectangular glasses.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:Mrs_garrison_senior.jpg|thumb|120px|Mrs. Garrison drinking tea.]]\nMrs. Garrison is much more like her son, and it is possible that he got his warped perspective on life from her because she was his primary carer. She becomes hugely upset when [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] says that his father never sexually molested him as a child, denying she knew this, crying \"If I knew, I would have made him do it!\" through tears.\n\nShe also says that her husband \"did the right thing\" when she thought he'd had sex with Mr. Garrison at night. She is very close to her son, repeatedly stating how proud she is that he's involved in the World Wide Recorder Concert. In turn, he seems very close to her; after he reduces her to tears by accusing her of being complicit in his father's non-abuse, he runs after her saying he was sorry. She thinks sexual molestation is an act of love, and insisting her husband molested Mr. Garrison \"repeatedly\", as if it was his duty as a father.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Damien]]\" (mentioned) - Mr. Garrison mentions that his mother was from Alabama after [[Damien Thorn]] says he's from the seventh layer of [[Hell]].\n*\"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\" - Seen consoling her son about the lack of sexual abuse by his father.\n*\"[[Go God Go XII]]\" - Cameo; seen in a photograph.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Cameo; seen in a photograph.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[zh:老加里森太太]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Eliza J.
