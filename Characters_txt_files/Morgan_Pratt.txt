He appears in the [[Season Nine]] episode, \"[[The Losing Edge]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[The Losing Edge]]\", Morgan is first up to bat for his team. [[Stan Marsh]] is pitching, and throws Morgan's first strike, all the while [[Randy Marsh]] is hailing \"Hey, Batter Batter\" from the stands. With Morgan ignoring Cartman's demand to at least swing at the ball, Stan throws a ball to get him to walk to first base.\n\nMorgan's eldest teammate tells Morgan to only swing if Stan throws a strike, much to his confusion. Stan attempts to throw a ball, but it is declared a strike, causing Cartman to yell at the umpire. Believing Stan's next pitch to be a ball, Morgan swings and hits the ball. He runs to first base with disappointment.\n\n==Appearance==\nMorgan wears a baseball uniform that is blue, orange, and white. He wears black shoes, and a blue and orange baseball helmet. His jersey is mostly blue, with orange trim. It has the team name \"Fort Collins\" on the front. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Morgan Pratt\">\nMorgan Pratt 1.png|Morgan at bat.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:摩根·普拉特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
