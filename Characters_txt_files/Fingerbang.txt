The other band members were [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Additional members that joined later included [[Wendy Testaburger]] and later [[Randy Marsh]], who replaced Kenny after he was killed by an elevator at the mall.\n\n==Background==\nCartman started the band as a way to make $10 million after dreaming about it. He also believed that the dream was a sign from [[God]]. Acting on Cartman's apparent divine guidance, [[The Boys|the boys]] formed Fingerbang. Realizing that they required a fifth member to be a real boy band, they held auditions at Cartman's house. [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] auditioned for the fifth place, but both were rejected. Eventually, Wendy was accepted by popular vote regardless of her being a girl, after singing a [[Wendy's Audition Song|wonderfully vulgar song]], despite Cartman's protests.\n\nThe group then made a music video, complete with stupid outfits and screaming fangirls, but Cartman was dissatisfied due to [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s filming. Unbeknownst to the band, the video had actually been taped over [[Liane Cartman|Cartman's mom]]'s porn. When they showed the video to the manager of the mall, he liked the porn and agreed to let them use the mall as their concert venue.\n\nUnfortunately, before the band's first concert, Kenny was killed by an elevator. Randy Marsh had to take Kenny's place. After Fingerbang's first concert, they decided that the fame was too much to handle and they went on indefinite hiatus. \"[[Fingerbang (Song)|Fingerbang]]\" is the only song they are known to have sung.\n\nCartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny re-unified as Fingerbang in \"[[Band in China]]\", with [[Butters Stotch]] on guitar and [[Jimmy Valmer]] on drums, continuing their roles from the band [[Crimson Dawn]]. The four boys wore the same white outfits that Cartman had dreamed about them wearing and filmed a sequence for a potential biographical film, but Stan ultimately called the whole thing off due to meddling by [[China]]. The band's other former members were not present.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Fingerbang\">\nSomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger035.png|Fingerbang demonstrating their abilities to the [[South Park Mall]] manager.\nSomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger086.png|Fingerbang performing in the South Park Mall.\nSomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger003.png|The original version of Fingerbang in Cartman's dream before starting the band\n</gallery>\n\n==Members==\n*[[Eric Cartman]]\n*[[Stan Marsh]]\n*[[Kyle Broflovski]]\n*[[Kenny McCormick]] - Crushed by an elevator before they could perform.\n*[[Wendy Testaburger]] - Accepted by popular vote after audition.
