At first, Scott thought that the Inuit had taken the princess, however, the Native Canadians told the group that they hadn't, but knew who had: [[Tooth Decay]].\n\nScott said he once paid an Inuk to give him a blowjob once, but all she did was rub her nose on his penis for 45 seconds and ask him to pay up.\n\nIn \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\", when [[Wendy Testaburger]] writes about intelligent dolphins, [[Eric Cartman]] says \"If Dolphins are so intelligent, why do they live in igloos?\", confusing dolphins with Inuit. Cartman then says \"Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie crap!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Eskimos speak Navajo instead of their traditional language.\n*In Canada, 'Eskimo' is a derogatory term to refer to the Inuit as it effectively means \"eaters of raw meat\", though it is a corrupted word that comes from similar Algonquian derivatives. This reinforces Scott the Dick's prejudicial tendencies when he referred to the Inuit characters as 'Eskimos'.\n[[zh:因纽特人]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Native American characters]]"
