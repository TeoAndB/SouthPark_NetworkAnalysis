She only made one on-screen appearance which was in \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", although she has been mentioned in dialog in other episodes.\n\n==Background==\nWhen Stan's friends [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] create a [[Facebook]] for him against his will, Stan begins to become assaulted by Facebook-type requests from everyone around him, including his grandmother. Apparently suffering from some sort of illness and hospitalized, Grandma Marsh spends much of her time on Facebook to keep in-contact with her family and friends. However, when Stan does not immediately \"friend\" her, she contacts her son Randy who then demands that he pay attention to his grandma's Facebook status.\n\nLater when Stan is literally \"sucked into\" Facebook, a digital avatar of his Grandmother is seen interacting with all of his other Facebook friends, at a digital party created by his now sentient Facebook profile. Once Stan defeats his Facebook profile in a game of Yahtzee, she and everyone else on Stan's friends list are transferred to [[Kip Drordy]].\n\n==Appearance==\nDespite her failing health and the suggested age of Grandma Marsh, she appears to remain relatively younger than Marvin. She has grayish white hair and glasses. However, due the fact that Grandma Marsh has only appeared as a digital avatar character in the techno-world of Facebook, her appearance may not exactly be accurate to her current state. Also she is not seen wearing normal attire, but instead she is seen wearing a Tron-like costume of glowing technology.\n\n==Family==\n===Marvin Marsh===\n[[File:Young Marvin Marsh with his wife.png|thumb|left|Young Grandma Marsh with her husband, Marvin|150x150px]]\nGrandma Marsh does not live with Stan's grandfather, [[Marvin Marsh]], implying that she and Marvin are separated or divorced.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*Grandpa Marsh is stated as being 102 years old and Grandma Marsh looks considerably younger than him.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Margaritaville]]\" - Stan quotes his grandmother who gave him a $100 check, claiming that he could use the money to buy whatever he wants.\n*\"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\" - First appearance and speaking role.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Seen as a young woman in a photo in Marvin's room in [[Shady Acres]].\n*\"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\" - Marvin discusses having sex with her and \"finishing\" on her breasts to avoid pregnancy; [[Randy Marsh]] was conceived accidentally when Grandma put her finger up Marvin's butt, causing him to ejaculate early.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n{{Marsh Family}}\n[[it:Nonna Marsh]]\n[[ru:Бабушка Марш]]\n[[zh:马什奶奶]]\n[[Category:Kern / Kimble / Marsh Family]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mona Marshall]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]"
