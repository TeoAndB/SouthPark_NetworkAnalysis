"{{South Park character\n|name = Mongolians\n|image = Mongolians-0.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Mongol\n|hair = Black\n|religion = Tengriism\n|appearance = \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Mongolians''' appear in the [[Season Six]] episode, \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\", and in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nThe Mongolians persistently break down [[City Wok]] owner [[Tuong Lu Kim]]'s city wall. Lu Kim was requested to build the wall to keep intruders from abducting [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s children. Eventually, the children are sent away and join the Mongolians, due to their parents' increasing paranoia and overprotectiveness. The Mongolians are able to break down the city wall once more with the use of explosives planted by the children.\n\nIt is explained by [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] that the Mongolians' justification in destroying the wall is that \"putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.\"\n\n==Appearance==\nThey all wear 13th-century-style clothing, have squinting eyes, and have long mustaches and beards. They carry swords as well as wooden shields. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mongolians\">\nChildAbductionisNotFunny138.png|The kids with the Mongolians.\nChildAbductionisNotFunny087.png|Three Mongolians on horseback.\n7237combat mongolians.jpg|Mongolians on the Tower of Peace fighting against the New Kid\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nThe Mongolians appear to be intelligent, easily outsmarting Lu Kim several times. Despite the fact that they destroy the wall several times, they never enter [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]. The only reason given for their attacking the wall is that Mongolians try to break down any wall built by Chinese people.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\nThe Mongolians are encountered as enemies in the [[Mongolian Beef]] side quest. At the top of the [[Tower of Peace]] are 5 Mongolian cavalry, but they are counted as one single enemy.\n\n===Abilities===\n*'''Mongolian Barbeque''' - Shoots a fire arrow. Inflicts burning if not blocked.\n*'''Sweet and Sour Surprise''' - Throws a pot of sweet and sour sauce. Inflicts burning if not blocked.\n*'''Blacken the Skies''' - Cast an arrow rain. Inflicts bleeding if not blocked.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Six}}\n{{HistoricalCelebrities}}\n[[zh:蒙古人]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!
