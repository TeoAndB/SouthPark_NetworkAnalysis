He first appears in the self-titled episode, \"[[Professor Chaos]]\". He originally becomes Professor Chaos due to the fact that he is occasionally seen to others as futile after being rejected as a replacement for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], making him a lonely outcast ultimately turning to the dark side. Professor Chaos later meets [[Dougie]] and makes him his new sidekick, [[General Disarray]].\n\n==Background==\n===\"[[Professor Chaos]]\"===\nAfter several episodes as [[the boys]]' fourth friend following [[Kenny Dies|the \"permanent\" death of Kenny]], Butters was fired by the others for being \"too lame\" and being unable to fill Kenny's niche. Fed up with such poor treatment by his classmates, he turns to a life of evil and builds his costume. Professor Chaos begins to attempt a reign of terror by switching Bennigan's menus, stealing erasers, among other minor crimes, and becomes increasingly frustrated with a lack of recognition from the town, blaming it on a government cover-up. His identity is soon figured out by another boy, who turns out to be Dougie, who joins him as General Disarray, due to their status as outcasts. He shows technical skill by hacking into a large screen at a baseball game where he announces his plans to flood the Earth, which again fails. His final plan is to use aerosol cans to deplete the ozone layer. This plan also fails.\n\n===\"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\"===\nProfessor Chaos becomes even more disillusioned with his plans when Dougie points out they all seem to be ripped off from the show \"The Simpsons\" and even when he comes up with good, original plans, the show uses them (including the one about replacing the chocolates in the cherries). He nearly suffers a mental breakdown, seeing everyone in the town as their Simpsons counterparts until the boys, [[Chef]] and [[Mr. Garrison]] finally help him realize all the ideas the Simpsons have already done are just carbon copies of ideas from other television programs. They also go on to point out that every idea has already been done in some way or another. With a new perspective, Butters returns to his plans of devastating the world.\n\nDuring this short arc, [[Diane Choksondik]] is killed, but her last surviving appearance is chasing off Professor Chaos.\n\n===\"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\"===\n[[File:GTWWR21.png|thumb|A hovering Anime Styled Chaos as featured in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\".]]\nHe is seen confronted as a primary antagonist against the boys in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\", where he is initially mistaken as Craig when Cartman asks, \"Craig, is that you?\" He is later revealed to be Butters after being hit with Kenny's shuriken. After getting struck by a shuriken, the boys try to hide him from their parents to no avail, even dressing him up as a dog and putting him in a shelter, but in the end, Butters' condition is ignored when Cartman's penis is shown in front of the entire town.\n\n===\"[[The Coon|Superheroes Arc]]\"===\nIn the 'Superheroes Arc', Professor Chaos does not display any electromagnetic superpowers as a villain like he did \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\", although they were just imaginary, and is defeated by [[Mysterion]] when Chaos and General Disarray fought him near the end of the episode. Cartman, as [[The Coon (Character)|the Coon]], seeks Chaos's assistance in order to figure out the identity of Mysterion. He then allies with Professor Chaos and bullies Chaos into threatening to blow up a hospital if Mysterion does not reveal his identity. When the Coon leaves, Mysterion confronts Chaos, and Disarray flees. Disarray soon rejoins the fight and flees again in their brawl against Mysterion. Then, the Coon comes to finish off Chaos by slashing him, thus making Chaos run away home. He later encourages Mysterion to reveal his identity otherwise crime can ensue.\n\nIn the later episodes of the Superheroes Arc, Chaos is only seen inside a holding cell at the [[Coon and Friends]] Headquarters as a punishment for his misdeeds, though it is not seen what his deeds were. At the end of \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\", The Coon is also in the same cell as Chaos after Cthulhu was defeated by Mint Berry Crunch.\n\n===\"[[Butterballs]]\"===\nAfter finally getting sick of his abusive Grandma, Butters becomes Chaos to try and stop her from bullying him, but she had adopted her own evil alter ego and easily overpowered Chaos with the threat of Gummy Bears.\n\n===\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\"===\nProfessor Chaos creates fake Facebook posts about the [[Coon and Friends]], ruining their reputation and keeping them from getting Netflix to greenlight their superhero franchise. He later hires a group of children to act as his minions, the Chaos Kids, and write even more fake posts about them. Butters then works with [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who aids him in his plan, allowing all fake posts to surface, as the public blindly accepts each post as 'news'. However, Professor Chaos is thwarted when the [[Coon and Friends]] simultaneously clear their names, defeat Zuckerberg, and force him to shut down Facebook entirely.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nA key to Professor Chaos's Lair and costume can be found at Butters' house. The lair is located at the storage facility where the player can befriend [[Dougie|General Disarray]], get several items, a Chinpokomon, and roof access. The Lair is set to activate numerous electrical items on arrival, with the claim that this will burn out all power in the world. If Paladin Butters is the player's companion, Paladin Butters will pass several compliments regarding the mysterious Professor Chaos.\n\nPaladin Butters' 3rd ability is \"Professor Chaos\" which has Butters turn into the anime style Professor Chaos, the player then spins a wheel to choose a random powerful ability. These abilities are:\n*'''Chaos Cloak''': Butters gives himself and [[The New Kid]] 9 shield.\n*'''Life Drain''': Butters takes HP off enemies and restores his and The New Kid's.\n*'''Hammer Of Chaos''': Butters calls down a huge hammer to damage all enemies stunning them.\n*'''Chaos Storm''': Butters zaps 5 random targets with electricity.\n*'''Chaos Blast''': Butters blasts all enemies with a laser resembling a [[w:c:dragonball:Kamehameha|Kamehameha]] from the ''Dragon Ball'' series, also Butters uses this move against Nazi Zombie Death in the Nazi Zombie Kenny final boss fight.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nThe Coon and Friends suspect that Professor Chaos is responsible for the missing cats and the troubles around town. While pursuing Professor Chaos, the New Kid learns the Sandblaster technique from Stan to blow away obstacles like Lava Lego. Both Freedom Pals and Coon and Friends buy into the roleplay that Professor Chaos is dangerous and untrustworthy. They then learn that Professor Chaos was paid $20,000 by a [[Mitch Conner|mysterious figure]], to put an end to both the [[Coon and Friends]] and the [[Freedom Pals]], and is using the money to hire Mexicans as his Minions and dress them in tinfoil as a boss. The Coon Friends and Freedom Pals must work together to stop him from spreading Lava Lego over the entire town, or nobody will be able to step outside ever again!\n\nAfter his defeat and capture, The Coon is fine with working with Professor Chaos to infiltrate the Freedom Pals, although the others do not trust him. Professor Chaos teaches the Player his '''Haywire''' Buddy Ability, and also requests the Player's aid in getting back his money in a spin-the-wheel mini-game at the bank, which is how the Player can find their income bracket and will gain Chaos' third attack.\n\nWhen the Player and Chaos infiltrate the Freedom Pal's lair, Doctor Timothy informs the team that he cannot 'rape' Chaos' mind because of his tinfoil helmet, and as a result cannot find out if Chaos' intentions are true. Nobody bothers to remove the helmet, as presumably this would be cheating.\n\nAt the end of the game, Chaos turns up at the Player's house and mockingly points out that \"no matter what, your dad will always have fucked your mom\", clearly having returned to his chaotic ways. He suggests you \"let your darker side free\", and the game ends on his evil chuckle...\n\nWhenever Chaos dies with Mysterion still in battle, Mysterion will comment that he \"died doing what was right\".\n\n====Abilities====\nProfessor Chaos specializes in attack and disruption from a distance. His Chaos Blast is similar to Human Kite's eye lasers, while his Chaos Confuse-O-Tron works best against enemies in the thick of their own formation, where they can catch their allies with Shock and target them via Confuse; if nothing else, its long range lets him hit foes from a wide variety of angles. His Chaos Minion is an effective meat shield, being able to move around and inflict damage to draw enemy fire. His Ultimate ability is a powerful weapon against clusters of foes.\n\nProfessor Chaos is a strong buddy on higher difficulties, where Shock does more damage and turning enemies against each other with Confuse can become even more useful.\n\nHis field ability is '''Haywire''', which allows the New Kid to fart a \"Winged Minion\" (a hamster with a tiny helmet and glider) at exposed wiring to deactivate certain devices.\n\n{{TFBW Superhero Abilities\n|Name = Professor Chaos\n|Image = Portrait_profchaos.png\n|Class = Blaster-Summoner\n|Health = \n|Move = 2\n|Description = Professor Chaos outsources chaos with ruthless efficiency, relying on an army of hamster minions, Chaos Kids and Minions to execute his vaguely evil plans.

Villains arrive and battle the five boys, but by the end, Chaos shatters a testicle, and is taken to [[Hells Pass Hospital]], the site of the next level, and afterwards is absent from the storyline.\n\nHe can be unlocked as a playable character if one has one of several unique special codes which were released with [[South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season]] or are awarded online if you are very skilled at the game. His move set is the \"Sniper\"-type used by [[Kenny McCormick]], [[Craig Tucker]], and [[Pip Pirrip]], with slow movement but heavy damage. His special ability is akin to that of [[Eric Cartman]], reigning chaos and causing heavy damage to enemies all over the screen.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:ProfessorChaos120.png|thumb|right|Professor Chaos with his sidekick General Disarray]]\nProfessor Chaos wears tinfoil gloves, helmet, boots, and a green cape. His helmet has a red dot on the forehead. His helmet has no top, showing Butter's blonde hair. He has aluminum shoulder pads, connected by a chain that goes across his chest, shoulder to shoulder.\n\nIn \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\", his appearance changes, such as becoming a muscular adult, his blonde hair becomes a blonde Mohawk, and boots change to feet wrapped in bandages, mimicking Muay Thai fighters who wear on bandages their feet. Professor Chaos mentions that his green cape is weaved with titanium. His eyes show no iris or pupils, like those of various anime characters in the episode, such as Bullrog's (Cartman) or Craig's.\n\n:''To see images of Professor Chaos, visit [[Butters Stotch/Gallery#Professor Chaos images|Butters Stotch/Gallery]].''\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nProfessor Chaos seems to be a mad-scientist-like villain whose goal is to bring chaos and disorder. In his debut episode, he was able to hack the Jumbotron screen at the stadium to announce that he is going to flood the world. This is the only exceptional act he has done as his immense powers in \"Good Times with Weapons\" are his imagination. He seems to be frustrated in \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\" because every plan he came up with had already been done by the Simpsons but got over it after Chef and Garrison concluded that ideas have always been done by another, hence passed down.\n\n===Super Powers===\nHis superpowers are only featured in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\". When donning on his costume, he turns into a large muscular man, surrounded with an electromagnetic aura. When introducing himself to the boys, he is able to hover above the ground and discharge bolts of lighting around him. His titanium cape is able to shield himself from special abilities cast by the boys. He is able to jump up in the air and land on the ground causing a miniature earthquake. He is able to instantly cast a web, thus trapping people such as Stan and Kyle in the \"Web of Holding\". After Kenny's shuriken cuts Chaos's eye, Professor Chaos reverts into Butters. In the Superheroes Arc, there is no indication of the superpowers he had in \"Good Times with Weapons\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Professor Chaos may be based upon Magneto from X-Men, as he can create electromagnetic pulses similar to him, as seen in \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\". He also has a similar helmet.\n*His costume is a satire of the costume worn by [[wikipedia:Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]], a villain in the ''[[wikipedia:Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'' comic book series.\n*He was plagiarized in the British comic The Dandy, page 7 of issue 3565. A young reader had sent a picture of Professor Chaos in as a competition entry, part of the prize for which is the character appearing in a comic strip. He is depicted as an adult superhero, the artist apparently having failed to notice that Professor Chaos is an existing character.<ref>[http://digifiend.webs.com/profchaos.jpg Scan of the plagiarized Professor Chaos]</ref>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Professor Chaos]]\"- First appearance.\n*\"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\"\n*\"[[My Future Self n' Me]]\" - Butters shows his costume to Stan, which he mistakes as coming out as gay.\n*\"[[Krazy Kripples]]\" - Seen at [[Christopher Reeve]]'s evil meeting along with other villains.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" (Cameo) - Seen in the crowd with all the characters.\n*\"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\"\n*\"[[Go God Go]]\"\n*\"[[The Coon]]\" - Teams up with the Coon to find out who Mysterion is.\n*\"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\" - Seen in the Coon and Friends jail and ask for food.\n*\"[[Mysterion Rises]]\" - [[Mysterion]] asks Chaos why he took a photo of a hobo with a photoshopped of [[Captain Hindsight]].\n*\"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\" - Asks if he can see the \"double rainbow\" and [[The Coon (Character)]] later joins him as his cellmate.\n*\"[[City Sushi]]\" (Mentioned only) - Nearly burned by Butters until Dr. Jauns interrupts him.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Tries to teach his abusive grandmother a lesson but she had already adapted a new super-villain of her own.\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\" (Costume only)\n*\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\" - Creates fake Facebook posts about the Coon and Friends to ruin their reputation.
