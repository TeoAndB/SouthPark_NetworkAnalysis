He is known to often collaborate with fellow filmmaker [[George Lucas]]. He first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[Cripple Fight]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Cripple Fight]]\", Spielberg is briefly seen withdrawing his support for the Mountain Scouts in support of gay rights after he finds out they banned [[Big Gay Al]] and gays from serving in their organization.\n\nSpielberg is featured more prominently in the episode \"[[Free Hat]]\", in which he and [[George Lucas]] release updated versions of their previous films, such as ''Star Wars'' and ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' with numerous and increasingly nonsensical changes, such as replacing guns with walkie-talkies. [[The boys]] campaign to stop them from editing films, but inspire Spielberg and Lucas to make changes to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.\n\nSpielberg is depicted as the more dominant and controlling of the two directors whom Lucas is submissive towards and believes he belongs to, behaving like a servant. The boys make an attempt to convince Lucas to return to them the original film version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', and Lucas seemed to agree with them until Spielberg arrived. Spielberg later convinces [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] to surrender so that the new movie can be seen. However, during the screening of the remastered version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', Spielberg and his associates' heads explodes because the changes make the film so terrible.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The China Probrem]]\", Lucas and Spielberg reappear, having apparently survived their initial encounter with the boys (or were resurrected through unknown means) having worked together on ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', as in real life. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], as well as the local district attorney and [[Mitch Murphy]] were horrified by the film, all remembering it as a series of graphic scenes in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape their beloved Indiana Jones character. ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]] enjoyed it, however.)\n\nThe boys, the district attorney and Murphy work together to file a lawsuit against Lucas and Spielberg for the rape. When the police arrive  at their home, they instead find that Lucas and Spielberg are still in the process of gang-raping a ''Star Wars'' [[Stormtrooper]], and they are subsequently arrested. The police later inform the boys that they found the dead raped bodies of Short Round and Yoda in the basement at Skywalker Ranch.\n\nThroughout the episode, various versions of Spielberg are seen during the rape flashbacks experienced by people who saw the films. Each version is a parody of the films ''Boys Don't Cry'' (lines only), ''The Accused'', and ''Deliverance''.\n\nIn \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]]\", Spielberg and Lucas, with [[Indiana Jones]] on a leash and in a ball-gag, are both members of [[Tom Cruise]]'s class-action lawsuit and usually seen together. Spielberg cautions Cruise that involving [[Barbra Streisand]] may be dangerous as she has not been active for a long time, and questions if they should activate her again.\n\n==Appearance==\nSteven Spielberg has been redesigned several times in his numerous appearances throughout the series. In \"[[Cripple Fight]]\", he appeared briefly behind his desk dressed in a turquoise suit, pink shirt, and blue hat. He was seen wearing glasses and had grey hair and beard, similar to his real-life appearance. In \"[[Free Hat]]\", he appeared dressed almost identically to the ''Indiana Jones'' character [[w:c:indianajones:René Emile Belloq|Belloq]], in a white suit and fedora, with a blue shirt and dark blue tie. \n\nHe was heavily redesigned for his appearance in \"[[The China Probrem]]\", in which he appeared dressed in a black coat, grey shirt, and brown trousers. He was also occasionally wearing a hat with \"Director\" emblazoned on it. His hair now has a different texture including some brown hair on top of his head and a different pair of glasses. He retained this look in future appearances.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Steven Spielberg\">\nSpielberg3.JPG|Steven Spielberg in \"[[Cripple Fight]]\".\nFreeHat139.png|Spielberg with [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in \"[[Free Hat]]\".\nFreeHat144.png|Spielberg with the remastered version of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.\nFreeHat151.png|Steven Spielberg dressed up as the [[Hebrews]]' High Priest\nTheChinaProbrem056.png|Steven Spielberg in \"[[The China Probrem]]\"\nTheChinaProbrem068.png|Steven Spielberg and George Lucas hunting Indiana Jones.\nTheChinaProbrem070.png|Spielberg raping Indiana Jones again.\nTheChinaProbrem077.png|Being arrested.\nEP200014.png|Spielberg and Lucas in \"200\".\nEP200098.png|Meeting Barbra Streisand.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*While \"[[Free Hat]]\" portrays Steven Spielberg as the mastermind behind the edits, with George Lucas reluctantly going along, in real life the two directors' attitudes ended up being the other way around. Spielberg later stated that editing ''E.T.'' was a huge mistake and vowed never to do such a thing again, while Lucas has seen numerous edits made to the original trilogy since this episode and has stated more may well occur.\n*In \"[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]\", [[Eric Cartman]] refers to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] as \"Steven Spielberg\" while they are filming their second video.\n*During the film festival in \"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\", a man on a cell phone says, \"''Well you tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass''.\"\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]\" (mentioned only)\n*\"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" (mentioned only)\n*\"[[Cripple Fight]]\" - pulls his funding from the Mountain Scouts\n*\"[[Free Hat]]\" - the boys take on him and Lucas for editing their films\n*\"[[The China Probrem]]\" - the boys want to sue him and Lucas for raping Indiana Jones\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n\n[[zh:史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:Criminal celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
