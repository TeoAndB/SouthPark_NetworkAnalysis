They perform at the [[Cirque Du Cheville]] in the [[Season Four]] episode, \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\". Only four of them have names: Glacas, Nadia, Natalia, and Baltania. The name of the fifth sister is never given.\n\nThey have an [[Romanian Father|absent father]], and are orphaned before the episode's events. Their [[Mrs. Vladchik|grandmother]] died of a heart attack during the episode as well. They lived briefly in the [[Marsh Residence|Marsh household]].\n\n==Appearance==\nBeing identical quintuplets, they all look exactly the same. They wear the same clothes as well, a light blue shirt with a large, white trim, and a blue skirt. They have what appears to be a white bow in their, abnormally wide, black hair.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Quintuplets\">\nQuintuplets011.png|The Quintuplets performing.\nQuintuplets016.png|The quintuplets grandma holding one of the girls up.\nQuintuplets069.png|[[The boys]] attempting to perform with the Quintuplets.\nQuintuplets077.png|The Quintuplets watch TV with the Marshes.\nQuintuplets097.png|The Quintuplets angrily addressing South Park's citizens.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nThey are friendly, but become hateful towards the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] (and America as a whole), and their [[City People|citizens]] after the events of \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\".\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[The Boys]]===\nIn \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\", the boys attempted to befriend them so they could use them in their own \"circus\".

It is very likely that they broke off their friendship with the boys, stating that the boys were \"the worst of them all\".\n\n===Family===\n===[[Romanian Father|Father]]===\nThey despise their father, who neglected them when they were younger. Also, he walked out on them five years earlier.\n\n===[[Mrs. Vladchik]]===\nAfter their mother died, their grandmother became their caregiver, it is presumed they had a close relationship before she died.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n\n[[zh:五胞胎]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Eliza J.
