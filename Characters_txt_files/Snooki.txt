She was discovered terrorizing [[Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails|Skeeter's Bar]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Randy Marsh]], [[Officer Barbrady]], [[Stephen Stotch]], [[Ned Gerblansky]], [[Jimbo Kern]], and a few others found the monstrous Snooki in the bar, where she was said to have torn a hole in the meat locker and broken the cigarette machine. When Jimbo first shot at Snooki, it ran away and proceeded to rape Stephen Stotch. Jimbo fired his shotgun again and it fled the building.\n\nSnooki later appeared at the [[Sizzler]], while [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] was trying to lock [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in the meat locker. It began to terrorize the children, raping [[DogPoo Petuski|DogPoo]] and Cartman. Kyle's Jersey side came out and he argued with the Snooki, telling it that it had cabbage in its muff. After Kyle punched Snooki, it ran away crying and was never heard from again.\n\n===Criminal Record===\n*'''Child sexual abuse:''' She engages in unauthorized sexual activity with Eric Cartman and DogPoo Petuski by raping them. This offense doubles as rape.\n*'''Rape:''' Snook rapes Stephen Stotch at one point as well.\n*'''Vandalism:''' She terrorizes Skeeter's Bar and breaks the cigarette machine.\n\n==Appearance==\nSnooki appears as a repulsive caricature of the real celebrity. She is hunchbacked and has large rodent-like ears and whiskers, a giant nose, sharp teeth, and a feline-like tail. She is short in stature and overweight, with enormous, pendulous breasts and large cellulite deposits on her thighs. She wears a black bikini top under a teal tube top, a lace bottom, and green slippers. A crucifix dangles around her neck and she carries a cocktail in one hand.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Snooki is known to frequently say the phrase \"Snooki want smoosh smoosh!\"\n*Snooki is often seen holding a cocktail or a jar of pickles.\n*When the Jersey Shore opening was shown to [[Osama bin Laden]], Snooki appeared in her monstrous form, unlike the rest of the cast, even saying \"Snooki want smoosh smoosh!\".\n*The real Snooki actually said on her Twitter account that she liked the episode and now wants smoosh smoosh.\n*The head of the Snooki is the icon for \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" on the [[South Park Studios]] website.\n*Snooki is a parody of E.T., from the movie ''[[Wikipedia:ET: The Extra Terrestrial|ET: The Extra Terrestrial]]''. The DVD outtakes shows Stan luring it with candy making the joke more obvious.\n*Snooki is also a parody of the [[Wikipedia:Thundercats (1985 TV series)|Thundercats]] character Snarf in terms of both mannerisms and appearance.\n*As of \"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]\", Snooki had been added to the [[Season Fifteen]] opening theme.\n*In one cut storyboard draft for [[Season Fourteen]], she appears as a human but with rather large breasts. Snooki gets shot by an unidentified character along with the rest of the Jersey Shore cast.\n*Another cut scene from said season depicts [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] attempting to save Snooki from getting shot by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the parents.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n\n[[zh:史努姬]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
