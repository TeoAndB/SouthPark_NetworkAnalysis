However, she discovers there is a Snuke in her vagina. Her fate is unresolved until \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]]\" where she is one of the celebrities suing the town, and questions [[Tom Cruise]] about the possibility of their careers being ruined.\n\nShe briefly appeared in the \"[[Queef Free]]\" song in \"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\".\n\nHillary is featured as [[Turd Sandwich]] in the episode \"[[Member Berries]]\", where she is the rival presidential candidate in the United States election against [[Herbert Garrison]], who is known as [[Giant Douche]] in the media.\n\nShe later makes a cameo during the ending of \"[[Put It Down]]\" where she pledges that if she becomes President, she will put down her phone and not tweet. However, the chorus rejects her pledge by telling her that \"no one cares\" about her.\n\n==Appearance==\nHillary Clinton has short, blonde hair, blonde eyebrows, and abnormally large buttocks. She was shown in a long sleeve, thick collar, light brown shirt, and brown pants. Later on in \"[[Member Berries]]\" her hair has slightly gotten whiter and wears a blue shirt. In \"[[The Damned]]\" she is wearing a red shirt.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Hillary Clinton\">\nHillary-clinton.png|Hillary Clinton's appearance prior to Season Twenty.\nHillaryclinton2.JPG|\"..but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger\".\nTheDamned00016.png|Hillary Clinton at the debate in \"[[The Damned]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nIn \"[[The Snuke]]\", she is manipulative, using the fact that she \"came from a small town\" to get [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s citizens to vote for her in the 2008 Presidential race. Though she is sometimes shown to be stupid as she continues to say \"My opponent is a liar and can not be trusted\", due to her advisors telling her to say it before, even though Mr. Garrison is giving her the power.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]\"\n*\"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\" - A news broadcast showed a live-action photograph of Clinton, with the anchorman saying that her \"ass just keeps getting bigger.\"\n*\"[[The Snuke]]\"\n*\"[[Britney's New Look]]\" - Seen on TV debating against [[Barack Obama]].\n*\"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\" - Seen briefly in the song [[Queef Free]].\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen as one of the many celebrities suing the town.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Same as mentioned above.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - She is seen debating her rival, [[Herbert Garrison]], on the Syrian Refugee/ issue.\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\" - Featured as the [[Turd Sandwich]] with [[Herbert Garrison]] as her rival in the United States 2016 election.\n*\"[[The Damned]]\" - Seen debating [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].
