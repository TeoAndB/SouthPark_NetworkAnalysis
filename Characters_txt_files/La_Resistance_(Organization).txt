The boys are admittedly disturbed by the gruesome acts of torture that Gregory claims their parents will do to them if they interfere, such as skinning them alive, burning them to death, or cutting off their penises and feeding them to pigs. He states that even though they may all die, what they stand for will live on forever. Gregory tells Stan and Kyle the address of where [[Christophe]] lives, due to his knowledge of mercenary, and to also help Stan and Kyle.\n\nWhen the boys try to save [[Terrance and Phillip]], they are caught and Christophe is killed. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] ghost appears and warns Cartman that they are running out of time, and that [[Satan]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] will arrive and plunge the world into eternal darkness.\n\nThis warning fails, and Terrance and Phillip are killed, causing Satan, Saddam, and multitudes of demons to appear and attack people. However, due to a malfunctioning \"V-Chip\", Cartman manages to shoot lightning to weaken Saddam. Kenny manages to get Satan to finish him off. Satan, showing gratitude towards Kenny for convincing him to leave Saddam, grants Kenny one wish. Kenny wishes everything to go back to the way it was \"before\". Satan grants this, therefore repairing the damage M.A.C. and his army of demons had done.\n\n===Flag===\nLa Resistance's flag is an anarchist flag with \"La Resistance\" written on it as well as the crudely drawn heads of [[Terrance and Phillip]].\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" | \n===Members===\n{|\n|\n*[[Gregory]] - (leader)\n*[[Stan Marsh]] - (co-founder)\n*[[Kyle Broflovski]] - (co-founder)\n*[[Eric Cartman]] - (co-founder)\n*[[Butters Stotch]] - (flag holder)\n*[[Christophe]] - (mercenary)\n*[[Wendy Testaburger]]\n*[[Bebe Stevens]]\n*[[Clyde Donovan]]\n*[[Craig Tucker]]\n*[[Francis]]\n*[[Token Black]]\n|\n*[[Bill Allen]]\n*[[Fosse McDonald]]\n*[[Terrance Mephesto]]\n*[[DogPoo Petuski]]\n*[[Red]]\n*[[Girl with Pink Flower Shirt]]\n*[[Kevin Stoley]]\n*[[Bradley Biggle]]\n*[[Heidi Turner]]\n*[[Annie Knitts]]\n*[[Millie Larsen]]\n*[[Esther]]\n|}\n| valign=\"top\" | \n===Former Members===\n*[[Jake]] - Left because there was no punch nor pie.\n*[[Kelly (\"Rainforest Schmainforest\")|Kelly]] - Left because there was no punch nor pie.\n|}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cartman has Kyle send out a promissory offer of punch and pie for the attendants, though this was a blatant lie used to lure the kids' attention.\n[[zh:反抗军]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
