She was later shot with a stray bullet, and after a tearful exchange with [[Eric Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Stan Marsh]], she hacked into the \"Cosmic Control Center\" in order to switch her and [[Kenny McCormick]]'s \"heaven/hell passwords\", resulting in her going to [[Hell]], while he went to [[Heaven]]. However, the site provided no evidence and was closely interlinked with [[fanon]], so any information beyond her status as a background character should not be treated as canon. In the final version of the film, she makes a few background appearances.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe has cherry blonde hair, a pink sweater with a flower on it, and lime green pants.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters Movie}}\n[[zh:粉花衣女孩]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mary Kay Bergman]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]"
