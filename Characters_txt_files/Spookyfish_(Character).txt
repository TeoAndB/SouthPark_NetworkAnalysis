He appears in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Spookyfish]]\".\n\n==Background==\nStan's Aunt [[Flo Kimble|Flo]] is visiting, and arrives with a gift for Stan, a small goldfish. Unbeknownst to Stan, Flo bought the fish at the [[Indian Burial Ground Pet Store]]. As the name implies, it was built over an ancient Indian burial ground. This had caused a portal to open to another dimension where the evil pets come from. Therefore, the fish is equally devious and kills several people while in Stan's care.\n\nThe first person the fish kills is an unnamed man with a green shirt in jeans. Stan wakes up the next morning to the fish having killed another person, a blond man with a blue shirt. The fish then kills Aunt Flo and Kenny McCormick while [[The Boys|the boys]] are visiting.\n\n[[Sharon Marsh]], out of love for Stan, buries the bodies and hides the evidence. Stan, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and Evil [[Eric Cartman]] go to the store and return the fish.\n\nAfter the chaos ended, the animals including the goldfish were later soon exterminated.\n\n===Criminal record===\n*'''Murder''': He is responsible for killing Stan's Aunt [[Flo Kimble|Flo]], [[Kenny McCormick]], and other people.\n\n==Appearance==\nSpookyfish is a small goldfish that lives in a fishbowl with plastic kelp.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n[[zh:鬼怪金鱼]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Kern / Kimble / Marsh Family]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Serial killers]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
