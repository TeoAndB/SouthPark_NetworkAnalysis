He never appears without the rest of his family or Kenny, and very little is known about him. He only has a speaking role in three episodes: \"[[Chickenlover]]\", \"[[Chickenpox]]\", and \"[[The Poor Kid]]\". He is often seen in the background with his brother or his family, usually at church or at Kenny's numerous funerals.\n\n==Appearance==\nKevin has wild, messy light brown hair, with a bandage, scratch, dirt, and leaves on his face. He wears gray pants and a red button-up shirt and has a set of braces. In \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\" he wears a light blue suit with a green tie, however, in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\" he wears a black suit with dark blue tie for Kenny's funeral.\n\nIn ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Kevin is seen as an adult man. He has visibly aged, his hair is greyed, there is a scar where his bandaid used to be, and there is still green gunk on his face. He wears a red shirt with stains and the sleves ripped off and a Colorado Avalanche shirt on underneath. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Kevin McCormick\">\nChickenpox07.gif|Kevin in \"[[Chickenpox]]\".\nQuintuplets02.gif|Kevin in \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\".\nKevin-The_Return_of_Chef.png|Kevin in \"[[The Return of Chef]]\".\nChar karen-1-.jpg|Kevin with the rest of his family in \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\".\nSexualHealing20.jpg|Kevin in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\" with a different hairstyle.\nKevin.png|Kevin at [[Kenny McCormick|his brother's]] funeral in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\".\n11-17-2011_6-03-04_PM.png|Kevin's newer appearance in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\".\nThePoorKidPromo.jpg|Kevin, [[Karen McCormick|Karen]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] being taken away by the police.\nThePoorKid16.png|Kevin, [[Karen McCormick|Karen]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] with [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead|the Weatherheads]] and their foster children.\nGoobacks11.jpg|Kevin seen with his family in \"[[Goobacks]]\".\nchicken lover.png|Kevin and Kenny watching their parents fight.\nCityPartofTownMcCormicks.png|Kevin with his family in \"[[The City Part of Town]]\".\nNaughtyNinjasKevinKennyKaren.png|Kevin with Kenny and Karen in \"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nKevin appears to be slow or a heavy drinker, he speaks in a slow, repetitive slur when talking normally. However, he talks much more quickly and clearly when yelling, and has a different voice in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''. Evidence of the latter is seen in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\", where his [[Carol McCormick|mother]] calls him and his [[Stuart McCormick|father]] \"drunk pieces of shit\". Kevin seems to have violent tendencies - he tells his mother to shoot his father and later attempts to strangle his father, initiating a fight. Kevin doesn't talk much. Throughout the series, we have only heard his voice three times and he is usually quiet.\n\n==Family==\n===[[Carol McCormick]]===\nKevin is Carol McCormick's oldest son. They are never seen interacting one-on-one, although, judging from the pseudo-conversation they had in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\", their relationship seems to be a weak one, filled with fighting. His relationship with his mother is likely stronger than with his father.\n\nHis mother does seem to care about him, because in \"[[Spookyfish]]\", she tells Kenny off for not sharing the blanket with Kevin. She also expects Kevin to share with Kenny, as shown in \"[[Chickenpox]]\" when she tells Kevin to split his waffle with Kenny.\n\n===[[Stuart McCormick]]===\nKevin is Stuart McCormick's oldest son. Judging from the events of \"[[The Poor Kid]]\", they do not have a good relationship. Their relationship also seems to be violent, likely when they are drunk, with Mrs. McCormick having to step in to prevent them from physically fighting each other. They seem to ignore each other, except when Stuart is drunk.\n\n===[[Kenny McCormick]]===\nKevin is Kenny's older brother. The two were never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. They seem indifferent to each other's presence, completely ignoring each other. When seen together, it is usually with the rest of their family. Neither Kenny nor Kevin don't like sharing with one another, because in \"[[Spookyfish]]\", Kenny tugs the blanket from him, and in \"[[Chickenpox]]\", Kevin has to share frozen waffles with Kenny, because of the lack of food. Kevin seems to tolerate Kenny a bit; in \"[[Chickenlover]]\", both were standing next to each other, giggling when their mom beat up their dad.\n\nIn \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\", Kevin was at the hospital with his family, looking at Kenny in his 'tomato' state. The two can also be seen playing together in \"[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]\".\n\n===[[Karen McCormick]]===\nKevin is Karen's older brother. The two were never seen interacting, so little is known about their relationship. Kevin seems to ignore her, however, she seems to look for him for protection, hiding behind him in various instances. When Kevin is fighting with Stuart, the argument does scare Karen, causing her to break down and start crying. Kevin shares a room with Karen because Karen is lonely most of the time. Unlike Kenny, Kevin doesn't show much care towards her. In \"[[The City Part of Town]]\", when Stuart starts yelling at Karen, Kevin merely responds with slight concern, although Kenny scowls and runs after her.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the early years of the show, he was sometimes referred to by fans as \"Brooky\", as the name Kevin was used by several characters.\n*Although the McCormicks are poor, Kevin appears to have braces.\n*Kevin's voice varies greatly between his first two lines and his third line in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\".\n*As of 2021, Kevin appears as a sci-fi card in ''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]].'' He speaks in a higher-pitched raspier voice without his Southern accent. His in-game model does not have braces.\n*Kevin shares a room with Karen in \"[[The City Part of Town]]\".\n*Kevin seems to have a better relationship with Kenny rather than the rest of his family since they are sometimes playing and having fun together.\n*In \"[[The List]]\", Kevin is shown to be left-handed, as he is seen eating with his left hand.\n*Kevin is the only McCormick family member who doesn't appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n**Kevin does appear in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', but unlike the rest of his family, the player cannot take a selfie with him.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - Seen sitting at the dinner table with his family.\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\" (speaking role) - He and his brother watch their parents fight.\n*\"[[Chickenpox]]\" (speaking role) - Seen at the table for dinner and his mother asks him to split a waffle with his brother.\n*\"[[Spookyfish]]\" - Seen with his family during a rainstorm.\n*\"[[Spontaneous Combustion]]\" - Seen at Kenny's funeral.\n*\"[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]\"\n*\"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\" - Seen in the living room at the [[Marsh Residence]] and in the audience at the Cirque du Cheville show.\n*\"[[Kenny Dies]]\" - Seen at his brother's funeral.\n*\"[[Cripple Fight]]\" - Seen at church with his parents.\n*\"[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]\" - Seen playing with his brother.\n*\"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\" - Seen in a family photo at the [[McCormick Residence]].\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\"- Seen at the Christmas tree lighting.\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\" - Seen when Cartman gives his speech.\n*\"[[Goobacks]]\" - Seen with his family trying to make a better future.\n*\"[[Best Friends Forever]]\" - Seen visiting his brother at the hospital along with the rest of his family.\n*\"[[The Return of Chef]]\"- Seen at Chef's funeral.\n*\"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\"- Seen briefly at [[Whistlin' Willy's]].\n*\"[[The List]]\" - Seen eating dinner with his family and stares in shock when his brother is shot by a stray bullet by Bebe.\n*\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" - Seen at Cartman and Kyle's aids benefit concert.\n*\"[[The Ring]]\" - Seen at his brother's funeral.\n*\"[[Sexual Healing]]\" - Seen at [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] 's funeral.\n*\"[[The Poor Kid]]\" (speaking role) - Fights with his father and is taken into foster care along with his siblings.\n*\"[[The Magic Bush]]\" - Seen sitting with his family during [[The Tale of Craig's Mom's Bush|the Magic Bush song]].\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - Seen with his family at the gentrification meeting and at home.\n*\"[[Naughty Ninjas]]\" - Seen at his house with his family.\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\" - Seen in the crowd with the rest of his family.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Rallies with [[Marcus Preston]] after witnessing his presentation in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|school cafeteria]].
