"{{South Park character\n|name = Funnybot\n|image = Funnybot.png\n|gender = Male Programming\n|race = Robot\n|job = Comedian\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1908258/|title=Funnybot on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Funnybot]]\"\n}}\n'''Funnybot''' is a robotic comedian created and manufactured in Germany with the purpose of entertaining people and proving Germans aren't the least funny people in the world.\n\nFunnybot appears in [[Funnybot|the episode of the same name]], in which he served as the main antagonist. After exhausting standard comedy routines, Funnybot decided to start slaughtering audiences to create \"awkward\" situations.\n\nHe eventually concluded that the \"ultimate joke\" would be the destruction of all biological life on Earth, which would be incredibly awkward. However, this plan was stopped by [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[The Boys|the boys]]. Funnybot later had a change of heart, understanding that comedy is about more than simple logic.\n\n==Appearance==\nFunnybot consists of a spherical head with a single visual sensor and aerial atop a conically-shaped body. The body is separated into two segments, each of which is capable of rotating independently of the other. The upper half of the body is equipped with a single 'plunger' manipulator, as well as several other retractable arms. Also concealed within the upper body are a pair of miniguns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Funnybot\">\nDalek = funnybot.jpg|A comparison between a Dalek and Funnybot.\nFunnybot14.png|The Germans present Funnybot.\nFunnybot17.png|Funnybot performing to a live audience.\nFunnybot18.png|Funnybot doing his stand-up routine.\nFunnybot26.png|Funnybot doing his stand-up routine with live ammunition.\nFunnybot20.png|\"''Awkward!''\"\nFunnybot32.png|Funnybot writing new material.\nScreen shot 2011-05-05 at 9.15.06 PM.png|Funnybot about to start a nuclear apocalypse.\n</gallery>\n\n==Quotes==\nAll quotes are from \"[[Funnybot]]\".\n*'''Funnybot:''' \"Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head!\"\n*'''Funnybot: '''\"What do you see when the Pillsbury Doughboy bends over? Dough-nuts!\"\n*'''Funnybot: '''\"What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina!\"\n*'''Funnybot:''' \"Awkwaaard!\"\n*'''Funnybot:''' \"I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!\"\n*'''Funnybot:''' \"It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward.\"\n*'''Funnybot:''' \"Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then \"Awkwaaard.\" Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.\"\n*'''Funnybot to [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]:''' \"Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together. I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*Funnybot is modeled heavily on the [[w:c:Tardis:Daleks|Daleks]] from the British science fiction show ''[[w:c:Tardis:Doctor_Who|Doctor Who]]'' in body design, sound, and mannerisms. Both are on a mission to destroy humanity, have a blatant disregard for human life, use a catchphrase (Funnybot's \"Awkward!\" to the Daleks' \"Exterminate!\"), feature electronically synthesized voices, manipulate items using a plunger arm, and have one eye on their head. Also, the \"Exterminate!\" phrase was also used by Funnybot.\n*The way Funnybot activates the missiles using an extending bar plugged into a circular socket is a reference to R2-D2 from ''Star Wars''.\n*Funnybot's full name is XJ-212.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[es:Chistobot (personaje)]]\n[[ru:Смехобот (персонаж)]]\n[[zh:搞笑机器人（角色）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Objects]]"
