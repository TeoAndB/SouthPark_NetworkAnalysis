He drinks lots of coffee, which causes paranoia and jittery muscle spasms. He made his first appearance in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Gnomes]]\", where it focused around him and [[The Boys]] doing a class project together.\n\n==Background==\nHis next major appearance was in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" where he and [[Craig Tucker]] were pitted against each other in a fight by the other children for amusement. He was later brought into [[The Boys|the main group]] from the [[Season Six]] episodes \"[[Professor Chaos]]\" to \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\". He was mostly used as a background character after leaving The Boys group in Season Six but continues to make frequent appearances and have speaking roles in the series from time to time. He is still in the extended group, [[Coon and Friends]].\n\n===Criminal Record===\n*'''Indecent exposure''': During the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out Movement]] of [[Season Twenty]], he joins [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' cause and frequently exposes his genitals.\n*'''Sexual harassment (alleged):''' In \"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\", Mr. Mackey sued Tweek for commenting on the shape of his butt.\n*'''Assault''': In \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\", Tweek beats up [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and vice versa, and they later fight again in the hospital. Tweek gets into another fight with Craig in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\".\n*'''Drug abuse''': Is seen drinking cough syrup in \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\". Tweek also unknowingly ingests meth regularly, as his parents lace their coffee with it.\n\n===Sexuality===\nBeginning with \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", Tweek is allegedly in a relationship with [[Craig Tucker]]. In \"[[Wieners Out]]\", Butters refers to the two as a gay couple when encouraging his male peers to join his movement. Despite their relationship being forced at the start, the two stay together of their own free will and are now more open about their sexualities and their relationship. In \"[[Put It Down]]\", [[Craig Tucker]] refers to Tweek as \"honey\" and \"babe\" even when not in front of other people. Assuming this means that they are actually in a relationship and they are not faking for publicity.\n\n===Talents===\n====Music====\nIn \"Put It Down\", Tweek is shown to be able to play the piano. At the start of the episode, due to him panicking, he was just hitting the keys and screaming, however, during the final song, Tweek is shown to play the piano very well.\n\n==Appearance==\nTweek has messy blond hair and wears an incorrectly-buttoned green shirt with blue jeans. In \"[[Gnomes]]\", his physical appearance was slightly different from more recent episodes; instead of a green collar, he had a black one, and his jeans were also of a darker color. During the metrosexual fad in \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\", he appeared in a pink track jacket with slicked down, tinted hair along with lowlights.\n\nIn \"[[T.M.I.]]\", it is shown that he has grown 1.9 inches since the last physical and with the penis length of 1.45 inches. According to the list made in the episode, Tweek probably has the smallest penis size among the boys besides [[Eric Cartman]], although it cannot be certain due to Chris Andrews' being covered by Craig's arm when posting it on the wall of the school hall with Clyde, meaning it might be the third smallest.\n\nIn ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', Tweek appears as an adult man. He still has messy blonde hair, although it is not as long as it used to be. He also has slightly sunken cheeks, and a similar green shirt, this time properly buttoned up.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Tweek Tweak}}\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:FreeHat03.jpg|thumb|Tweek finding his center.]]\nTweek is rarely seen smiling or expressing positive emotions, being almost constantly on the verge of outright panic. He is usually seen gritting his teeth or generally flipping out. He also appears to be easily manipulated, making him a frequent pawn of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s plots (\"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\", \"[[Free Hat]]\") although he does maintain a disliking to Cartman as most others do.\n\nTweek does not fare well under stress, often experiencing feelings of extreme paranoia whenever he is given a task to complete. This, in addition to his general forgetfulness and lack of focus, has given him the reputation of being highly unreliable. Apart from being easily excitable and prone to panicking, Tweek has also shown signs of exaggerated paranoia, often dreaming up of (mostly unfounded) negative eventualities to simple actions. When under extreme stress, he has also been known to retreat into his imagination (\"find [his] center\"), often picturing peaceful, grassy fields or tranquil landscapes to calm himself down.\n\nBy contrast, he has also been shown to have a strong moral center and a willingness to act upon it. For example, he stood up for his friends in \"[[Free Hat]]\", wielding an RPG and telling [[Steven Spielberg]], \"All I want are my friends!\" Although he is easily manipulated, he usually does not willingly take a role in Cartman's schemes, remaining neutral or passive.\n\n===Disability===\nAccording to his parents, Tweek suffers from [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] (ADD), but it is revealed in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' that his parents lace his coffee (and all the coffee they sell) with Meth, which he drinks like water. Whenever they think he needs to calm down, they just give him more coffee. He twitches similar to [[Rebecca Cotswolds]] or [[Thomas]], which is likely caused by all of the coffee (or meth) he drinks. [[Craig Tucker]], as shown in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", is able to calm him down and stop the twitching - briefly.\n\n==Family==\n===Parents [[Richard Tweak|Richard]] and [[Mrs. Tweak]]===\n[[File:ChildAbductionIsNotFunny01.jpg|thumb|Tweek with his parents.]]\n[[Richard Tweak|Richard]] and [[Mrs. Tweak]] own [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse|a local coffee shop]]. They supply their son with coffee (mixed with grounded meth), unaware it is the cause of Tweek's physical and mental problems, instead blaming it on attention deficit disorder.\n\nThey are not shown to be the best parents; in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\", Tweek's father tries to communicate through long-winded anecdotes that \"never go anywhere\" while in \"[[Gnomes]]\", he uses flowery similes and metaphors (\"A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon, or a hug from your dear old aunt...\") that sometimes exasperate his son. Exasperated, Tweek once exclaims \"You guys never help me! Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!\"\n\nIn \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\", they cause Tweek's nervousness to skyrocket when they turn their home into a virtual prison and conduct random safety drills after stories regarding child abduction surface on the news. It is Tweek's parents' clumsy approach to parenting that almost gets him kidnapped by a child molester (the Ghost of Human Kindness), precipitating the events of the episode.\n\nDuring \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", his parents were amongst the majority of the town in support of Tweek and Craig’s spontaneous relationship. While at dinner his father readily shows his support for his son supposedly being a homosexual. They further supported Tweek’s relationship by being hospitable to Craig once he comes to visit Tweek, offering him coffee. However, the episode also implies that they, or at least Richard, are only supportive of Tweek because having a gay son makes them seem more progressive and better parents, as Richard callously tells Tweek that he always assumed he was \"just a spaz\". This is repeated in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', where Richard asks the New Kid to help get Tweek and Craig to make up because having a gay son is good for business.\n\n===[[Stripe|Stripe #4]]===\nNothing is known about Tweek's relationship with his co-owned guinea pig, other than the fact that he bought Stripe #4 for his boyfriend, [[Craig Tucker|Craig]].\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Craig's Gang]]===\n[[File:Snapshot 1 (6-23-2011 12-31 AM).jpg|thumb|Tweek as part of [[Craig's Gang]].]]\nCraig's gang consistently includes [[Craig Tucker|Craig]], [[Token Black|Token]], and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], while Tweek often plays a role as the fourth member. Depending on the situation, the fourth member is sometimes Jimmy Valmer instead.\n\n===[[Craig Tucker]]===\nTweek and Craig's first notable interaction was their fight in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\". In the episode, the two were repeatedly goaded into fighting each other for the other boys' entertainment. However, the animosity between them seems to have been resolved, and as they are often seen together, they may be assumed to be friends.\n[[File:TweekvsCraig067.png|left|thumb|Craig and Tweek before their fight in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\".]]\nNotably, Tweek can be seen with Craig in the majority of his background appearances. In \"[[Ginger Kids]]\", they are trapped in a cage together, and in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\", they are on the same side of the town. In \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", Tweek is seen working in the same study group as Craig, in \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\", they are playing football together along with [[Token Black|Token]], [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], and [[Kevin Stoley|Kevin]], and at the end of \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\", they can be seen standing next to each other. Tweek also hides scared behind Craig in \"[[Marjorine]]\", when they are all spying on the girls' house. In \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", they sit next to each other at [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s birthday table. At the school assemblies, they are often seen sitting next to each other. \n\nIn \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", the new female Asian students are drawing [[Yaoi]] pictures of Tweek and Craig in love. To stop the drawings, the two stage a fake breakup, but Tweek goes too far and makes Craig out to be a cheater by inventing a \"Michael\" character for dramatic effect. The two later reunite after their breakup crushes the town's spirit, and are seen holding hands and playing video games with each other. In \"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\", they are seen holding hands still in the school hallway.\n\nIn \"[[Wieners Out]]\", they are seen together in the gymnasium watching the girls volleyball game and then proceed to flash their genitals during the national anthem in support of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' movement. In \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\", Kyle commands Tweek and Craig to respond to his offensive posts towards gay people.\n\nDespite originally maintaining a fake relationship for the sake of the town, the two end up staying together by choice even after the town loses interest. Craig refers to Tweek as his boyfriend in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' and openly tells the player that he is gay. It is also revealed that Tweek bought Craig his [[Stripe|fourth guinea pig]].\n\nIn the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode, \"[[Put It Down]]\", Tweek stresses over the nuclear bomb threats made by North Korea. Craig suggests that he make cupcakes for them, and this worked until [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] insisted that Tweek had pooped in the cupcake batter, and continued to make things worse with several other tweets. Craig tries his best to make Tweek feel better by giving him logical answers, which only made things worse. But after hearing [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s speech about grieving, he comforts Tweek and talks with him about how he is feeling, helping him truly feel better.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===[[The Boys]]===\n[[File:FreeHat035.png|thumb|Tweek with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]].]]\nIn \"[[Gnomes]]\", [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] places Tweek in the boys' group for their homework assignment. The boys initially express their disdain at this, saying \"Dude, we can't work with this kid!\" However, as the episode progresses, they slowly warm to him.\n\nIn later episodes, Tweek is shown to consider the main boys as his friends. In the episode \"[[Professor Chaos]]\", he is chosen to take the position of the fourth friend in the sixth season to replace [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]. In \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", when the boys decide they have to make room for Bebe in their group, Kyle and Stan defend Tweek and kick Cartman out instead.\n\nHe also seems to enjoy hanging out with the boys, however, it is shown that Tweek does not want to be a part of the strange, crazy adventures that the boys regularly embark on, at one point in \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\" remarking, \"That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!\"\n\nTweek is never officially kicked out of the group, as Butters was, but judging from his unexplained absence following \"[[A Ladder to Heaven]]\", it is assumed that he drifted back to his old friends. However, he stays on friendly terms with the main boys too, often being invited to help with their latest schemes.\n\n===[[Eric Cartman]]===\nCartman has nothing against Tweek (even electing to replace Kyle instead of Tweek initially when they wanted to let Bebe in the group in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\"), but Tweek seems to harbor some dislike for Cartman.\n\nIn \"[[Free Hat]]\", Cartman pressured Tweek into making hats and threatened him into shaping up, or else, he would be kicked out of the group. Later on in the episode, when Kyle, Stan, and Cartman are being held hostage by [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]], Tweek comes to save them wielding an RPG, saying, \"All I want are my friends!\" Cartman seems touched by this, until Tweek adds, \"Except for Cartman, you can keep him.\"\n\n===Social Standing in General===\nTweek is rarely seen by himself; he is almost always shown with a peer or a group of peers. He also placed in the top ten on the girls' [[The List/Trivia|list of cutest boys]].\n\nIn \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", Tweek is invited to the girls' big whore party, along with the rest of the boys, excluding Cartman.\n\nHowever, his appearances have tapered off in recent seasons, and he is conspicuous by his absence from the rest of the group's slumber party in \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\".\n\n==Quotes==\n*'''Tweek:''' \"They're taking my underpants!\" from \"[[Gnomes]]\".\n*'''Tweek:''' \"They took my underpants, soon they'll want my blood!\" from \"[[Gnomes]]\".\n*'''Tweek:''' \"Rrrrr! You guys never help me! Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!\" from \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\".\n*'''Tweek:''' \"They're going to get me!\" from \"[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]\".\n*'''Tweek:''' \"Maybe they wanna kill us!\" from \"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\"\n*'''Tweek:''' \"Gnaaahahahah! I pulled out my hair!\" from \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\".\n*'''Tweek: '''\"Craig, can I touch your penis!?\" from \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" being forced to say that by PC Principal.\n\n===Catchphrases===\nTweek also has a couple of involuntary verbal tics, like \"''nngh''!\" and \"''gah''!\", which interpose his dialogue.\n\n*\"Oh man, that is way too much pressure!\"\n*\"Gah!\"\n*\"Oh Jesus!\"\n*\"Ahhh!\"\n*\"Eeek!\"\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park Rally]]''===\nTweek serves as an unlockable character in the racing game South Park Rally. To unlock him, the player must enter championship mode with any character and collect five caffeine turbos (blue speed lines on the blue item box) during the spring cleaning race.\n\n===''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''===\nTweek plays a small role in the storyline of ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'' and appears at the end of the \"Great Wall of South Park\" level to inform the player the villain is hiding at the Docks, panicking that he was explicitly told not to tell him. The boys show a lack of trust in him and run off to fight without him. He is in the same \"Medic\"-type class as [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Timmy Burch]], and [[Bebe Stevens]], moving quickly but dealing minimal damage. His special ability causes [[Make Love, Not Warcraft|light himself on fire]] and as long as he is on fire, any enemy he touches is dealt with heavy damage or dies.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\n''Hot Coffee'' is part of the main quest where Cartman asks the player to recruit Tweek. He can be found in the [[Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse]] behind the door marked ''Employees Only''. He sends [[Douchebag]] on a mission to get the \"Special Delivery\" from [[Kenny McCormick]]'s house since he would not be allowed to play with the boys until he finishes his chores. Once Douchebag obtains the delivery from the meth-making tweekers in Kenny's garage, he returns to Tweek's house, where Tweek friends him on Facebook and his father allows him to go play.\n\nHe also assists in aiding the raid on the Inn of the Giggling Donkey, coming in after Cartman tells the player to go and rescue Princess Kenny. While not playing an actual role here, he goes along with the others to aid Cartman while the player heads upstairs.\n\nHe is seen again at the school if the player decides to side with Cartman rather than Kyle. Here, he is assisting in the fight against the elves alongside the player. He sends the player a message asking if everyone was dead and is not seen again after this.\n\nIf you talk to him after the end of the game, he will say that he is glad yesterday is over, while worrying that today might be worse. He will also say that he cannot talk because he needs to practice.\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"120\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nTweekadvcard.png|'''[[Outlaw Tweek]]'''\nTweekscicard.png|'''[[Warboy Tweek]]'''\nTweekmyscard.png|'''[[Imp Tweek]]'''\nTweekfancard.png|'''[[Robin Tweek]]'''\nTweekSupCard.png|'''[[Wonder Tweek (Phone Destroyer)|Wonder Tweek]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\nAlthough Tweek has fewer speaking roles than other background characters such as Craig or Clyde, he generally plays a larger role in the episodes in which he does appear.\n\nIn the [[Season Six]] episodes \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\", \"[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]\", \"[[Free Hat]]\", \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", and \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\", he replaces [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] (who in turn replaced [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]) as the fourth friend.\n\nFollowing \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\", Tweek stopped appearing as part of the main group, due primarily to Kenny's re-introduction, first as a spirit sharing Cartman's body, and later when he was brought back permanently in \"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\". He has made several background appearances but does not have another major role until the episode \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", in [[Season Nineteen]].\n\n*\"[[Gnomes]]\" - First appearance, is placed in [[the boys]]' presentation group by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].\n*\"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" - The other boys trick him into fighting [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] for their amusement.\n*\"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\" - Is sued by [[Mr. Mackey]] for making an unwarranted comment about his ass.\n*\"[[Chinpokomon]]\" - Seen with Chinpokomon.\n*\"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\" - Seen cheering on the fight between Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat.\n*\"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\" - Seen on Stan and Kyle's debate team.\n*\"[[Fourth Grade]]\" - Joins the other boys in attempting to stay in the third grade.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Is one of the kids invited over by Cartman to plan a way to get rid of [[Scott Tenorman]], but leaves after finding out that this is just a revenge scheme.

Coffeehouse]], went out of business because [[Harbucks]] opened a branch in South Park, though his father was hired to manage Harbucks. However, Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse is mentioned later in the series nonetheless.\n*Tweek seemed to practice [[wikipedia:fatalism|fatalism]] in the episode \"[[Free Hat]]\".\n*Tweek was worshiped as a deity by the \"sea people\" in the episode \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\", though he was not pleased about it. All his followers were quickly killed in conflict with Cartman's followers.\n*Tweek apparently speaks fluent Mongolian, as do the other kids, which he puts to use when he talks to the Mongolian warriors he lives with for a short time in \"[[Child Abduction is Not Funny]]\".\n*In the game ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', Tweek was ejected from the group for not paying enough attention to the boys, and being overly nervous.\n*Tweek is an unlockable character in ''South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play''. His special ability is running faster and killing anything that he runs into for five seconds.\n*Tweek has not appeared in Mr. Garrison's class since \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\". He would later return in \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\".\n*In later seasons, Tweek seems to have gotten better with his shaking and eye ticks.\n*It is hinted that Tweek, along with his parents, are supposed methheads; during ''South Park: The Stick of Truth, ''he sends Douchebag to fetch \"the package\" from the McCormicks' meth lab and deliver it to Tweek Bros. Coffeehouse for mixing into the coffee. [[Richard Tweak]] takes a test lick of the meth after its delivery and mentions \"it's good shit\". This hints that the meth in the coffee is actually what causes his nervous, jittery condition.\n*Despite claiming otherwise, Tweek appears to be a very good actor, as in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", he is able to convince the school that his \"break-up\" with Craig is genuine. For a second after his performance, he smiles, suggesting he thought he did well with his acting.\n*Tweek appears slightly shorter than other students, as his legs show less than others. This could be referencing the popular belief that coffee stunts growth in children.\n*In \"[[Cripple Fight]]\", a boy who looks like Tweek with black hair is seen sitting among the boy scouts.\n*Tweek may suffer from [[Wikipedia:Trichotillomania|trichotillomania]], which is an impulsive disorder when people pull out their hair or someone else's.\n*Tweek, along with Craig, is the first child character on the show to be in a same-sex relationship.\n*It is possible that Tweek is in the book club, has he can be seen sitting around the fire in \"[[Black Friday]]\" after Jimmy says, \"Aside from us, (him, Stan and Craig) the book club and Jessica Pinkerton\".\n\n==See Also==\n*[[LGBT in South Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*''Critical representations of work and organization in popular culture,'' pages 129-132.
