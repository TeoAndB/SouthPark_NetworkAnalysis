He appears in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[Cartmanland]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Eric Cartman]] inherits $1,000,000 from his [[Mabel Cartman|late grandmother]] and spends all of it buying the [[North Park Funland]] amusement park. Mr. Fun had reservations about selling his park because attendance had gone down causing the business to lose money. When Cartman tells him he wanted the park to himself, by not allowing anyone else in, Mr. Fun relents.\n\nPeople are attracted to its exclusiveness, which causes some people to be let in, in order to keep the park upkeep current and maintained. Cartman eventually becomes angry at all the people in his park, who take up all of the rides, and he demands his money back from Mr. Fun, who returned the money after seeing how successful Funland has become. After getting his money back, Cartman loses all of it to the IRS as a settlement over the recent death of [[Kenny McCormick]].\n\nHeavily in debt and lawsuit, Cartman tries to cancel the deal and make his money back. Mr. Fun simply turns down Cartman's request, indicating that he is an egoistic merchant after all.\n\nAlthough Frank is not such a memorable character, he did some cameos after his debut.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Fun is an overweight man with red, balding hair. He wears red pants, a white shirt, a yellow coat with various colored polka dots, orange shoes, and red tie with white polka dots.\n\n==Quotes==\n''Nohoho way, José!''\n\n''\"I don't care,\" said Pierre. \"I'm from France.\"''\n\n*These two sentences may refer to something, or they are just generic.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - Debut.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen in the crowd, near the end of the episode.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n\n[[ja:フランク・フーン]]\n[[zh:弗兰克·冯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
