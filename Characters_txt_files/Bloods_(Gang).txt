Jimmy and Timmy accidentally cause a tanker truck to crash into a group of Bloods, killing thirteen of them, which results in the Crips allowing them to join their gang. Later on, a few of the Bloods retaliates by attempting to kill Jimmy and Timmy in their houses in a drive-by shooting, though they are unsuccessful. As a result, Jimmy and Timmy decide to rent out the rec center in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and have the Crips and Bloods locked in together in the [[Denver Recreation Center|local recreation center]] until they resolve their differences. While they are initially hesitant, they soon realize that the two gangs have a lot in common, and they end up making a friendship with each other, including singing and playing basketball.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Bloods consist of primarily minority characters who wear red-colored shirts and bandanas and have a few tattoos.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n[[fr:Bloods (Gang)]]\n[[zh:血帮]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"
