She was considered to be \"top bitch\" at the retirement home until [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] successfully stole all of her Hummels and brought them to [[Marvin Marsh|Marvin]] to mutilate her with. \n\n==Appearance==\nMs. McGullicutty is an elderly woman with white hair and golden-rimmed glasses. She wears a purple jacket, and a hospital gown with piss stains on it, that happens to reveal her butt when seen from behind. She also wears black shoes and has a blue blanket draped over her back. She is described by Marvin as having \"old lady farts\", and she is depicted using said farts to intimidate nearly everyone she comes into contact with.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[es:Beatrice McGullicutty]]\n[[fr:Beatrice McGullicutty]]\n[[zh:碧翠丝·麦古丽卡蒂]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by April Stewart]]"
