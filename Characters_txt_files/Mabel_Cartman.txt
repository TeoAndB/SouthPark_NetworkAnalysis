She was married to [[Harold Cartman]].\n\n==Background==\nHer first appearance was when [[Eric Cartman]] called her amongst his other relatives and friends so as to remind them to watch him sing part of the [[Cheesy Poofs Theme Song]] in a [[Cheesy Poofs]] commercial.\n\nMabel and the other Cartman relatives appeared prominently shortly after in the episode \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", in which her daughter [[Liane Cartman]], along with Eric, [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Kenny McCormick]] go to spend Christmas with the Cartman family in [[United States#Nebraska|Nebraska]].\n\nCartman was particularly excited due to the fact that his grandmother always gave him spectacular gifts. However, he was sorely disappointed when Mabel gave him a simple shirt, stating that she had gone senile and needed to be put into a home. The family would later enjoy a family dinner, along with Mabel's son [[Howard Cartman]], who was in prison and who joined the family via TV. Howard, along with his cell mate [[Charlie Manson]] would later break-out and hold the family hostage, until they were at last re-arrested by the police.\n\nGrandma Mabel later died of an unknown cause, and the funeral was depicted in \"[[Cartmanland]]\". Cartman was furious at the funeral being held on a Saturday and complained throughout it all, stating \"It didn't take her this long to die.\" However at the reading of the will it was revealed that, she left her family next to nothing money-wise due to the fact that they would \"Just spend it on crack\". All of her wealth, which rounded off to a million dollars, was left to Eric, who used the money to buy his own amusement park.\n\n==Appearance==\nMabel appears to be quite old, with an aged face with many wrinkles. She wears a lavender colored sweater and gold-rimmed glasses. She has grey hair.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mabel Cartman\" widths=\"160\">\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson22.png|Mabel Cartman in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nLike the rest of the Cartman family, she appears to have adopted some of Eric's mannerisms, albeit to a much lesser extent than most of her family members. She is generally much more level-headed and considerate than most of her family.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" - Speaks to Eric on the phone about the [[Cheesy Poofs]] commercial.\n*\"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" - She appears, along with the rest of the Cartman family, when [[The Boys|the boys]] come to visit them in [[United States#Nebraska|Nebraska]].\n*\"[[Cat Orgy]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a portrait.\n*\"[[Quintuplets]]\" - When Randy tells the boys to step forward who has a grandmother, Cartman and Stan step forward.\n*\"[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]\" - (Cameo) Seen in a photograph in the [[Cartman Residence]].\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - (Mentioned)\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - She does not appear, but is mentioned posthumously.
