She made her first appearance in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" where she was participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad. She is now commonly seen as a background character.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe has long black hair with parted bangs. She wears a light purple jacket (similar to [[Wendy Testaburger]]'s) and cream-orange pants. As a \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\", she wore a blue, pink, and white tube top, a short, hot pink skirt, and pink high heels. It is worthy to note that she looks extremely similar to [[Tammy Nelson]].\n<gallery caption=\"Images of Beth\" widths=\"160\">\nTammynelson-lookalike.png|Beth dressed as a \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nBecause of her minor speaking role, little is known about her personality. In \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", she was in the closet with Clyde for two minutes and judging from his reaction afterwards, we can assume she did something to him involving the anus and/or spanking. However, due to the fact that she was participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad, no accurate personality traits can be assumed from this.\n\n==Prominence==\n:''This list is incomplete.
