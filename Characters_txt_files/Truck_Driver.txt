He first appears in the [[Season Five]] episode \"[[It Hits the Fan]]\". He plays his first speaking role in the episode \"[[Butt Out]]\", where he is seen smoking at the bar and entering in an argument with [[Rob Reiner]]. He is among the rednecks of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n\n==Background==\nHe later appears in \"[[Free Willzyx]]\", here he gives the boys a lift and helps them take [[Jambu]] to Mexico, which according to him, the boys said they had gotten the killer whale at Pizza Hut. He learns that the whale was actually stolen when Sea Park Announcers named [[Brian (Sea Park Announcer)|Brian]] and [[Mike (Sea Park Announcer)|Mike]] stop the truck. When Mike is about to tell Kyle that he and Brian have a prank on him, two cops arrive and notice the stolen whale in the truck. When they are about to arrest the Truck Driver and the others, the [[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]] members arrive to defend the boys. After a brief discussion, they start a shooting and kill Truck Driver along with Mike and the cops.\n\nDespite being killed, he reappears on \"[[Imaginationland]]\" giving [[Eric Cartman]] a lift at the end of the episode.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is best known for his old blue cap with a red border and a white sign written \"BUDS LIGHT BEER\". He also wears a white button down shirt under a blue sailor jacket, a black belt with a gold buckle, dark blue pants and black shoes. He has gray hair and a lot of wrinkles on his face. He also has an unusual wide mouth.\n\nIn \"[[Free Willzyx]]\" he wore a similar outfit, except that the jacket was dark brown instead of blue. His cap plate has been removed and his hair is black instead of gray. The wrinkles on their faces have also been removed.\n\nIn \"[[Smug Alert!]]\" he looked almost identical to his original appearance, only with brown hair instead of gray.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[It Hits the Fan]]\" - Debut Appearance; Seen at the bar.\n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" - Gets into a discussion with [[Rob Reiner]] and says he works at a sawmill.\n*\"[[Goobacks]]\" - Seen with the other Rednecks.\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - Seen in the background while Jimmy talks to Nut Gobbler.\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" - Seen as the crowd left the Park County Community center at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Die Hippie, Die]]\"\n*\"[[Follow That Egg!]]\" - Explain to Mrs. Garrison to appeal to the governor.\n*\"[[Free Willzyx]]\" - He gives the boys a lift.\n*\"[[The Return of Chef]]\" - Seen at the bar.\n*\"[[Smug Alert!]]\" - He is seen as one of the people that [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] tries to make jealous of his hybrid car.\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" - Seen at the bar cheering for [[Randy Marsh|Randy]].\n*\"[[Imaginationland]]\" - He gives Eric Cartman a lift.\n*\"[[Britney's New Look]]\" - His two appearances are seen in the crowd taking pictures of [[Britney Spears]].\n*\"[[W.T.F.]]\" - Seen at the beginning of the episode watching the wrestling match.\n*\"[[Cock Magic]]\"\n*\"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\" - He can be seen with the other rednecks who are angry at [[Alexa]] who is \"taking her jobs\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nButtOut038.png|The original look of Truck Driver.\nTruckDriver1.png|The Truck Driver helps boys get the whale to Mexico in \"[[Free Willzyx]]\".\nTruckDriver2.png|The Truck Driver after learning that the whale was actually stolen.\nTruckDriver3.png|The Truck Driver in \"[[Imaginationland]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*His appearance on \"[[Free Willzyx]]\" is very reminiscent of Stan Marsh, like his black hair, blue and red cap, brown jacket, and blue pants.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[zh:货车司机]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]"
