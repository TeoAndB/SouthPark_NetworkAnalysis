He appeared in \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\" as a member of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s [[Legion of Doom]].\n\n==Appearance==\nKim has the stereotypical characteristics of Asians seen in the series such as small eyes. He also has various facial wrinkles, an abnormally large nose, thin, black eyebrows, and thick, peach-colored lips. He wears a green, presumably button-up shirt.\n\n==Personality==\nKim does not have a major role in \"[[Krazy Kripples]]\", so little is known about his personality, however, it can be assumed he has a lust for power and is ill-intentioned, as he joined [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Legion of Doom, a short-lived supervillain organization.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''Team America: World Police'', which was also created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], Kim Jong-il speaks in a very similar voice to [[Tuong Lu Kim]]. He is the main antagonist in that film, and his personality is likened to that of [[Eric Cartman]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n\n[[zh:金正日]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Atheists]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Criminal celebrities]]"
