He made his first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\".\n\nThe character is referred to as '''Quake''' in the official season 4 and 5 scripts that were released<ref>[[Media:413.pdf|South Park - \"Trapper Keeper\" by Trey Parker]]</ref>, but the name 'Quaid' has been used more recently by South Park Studios and in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nQuaid debuts in \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\" where he and Filmore have heard about a new student, [[Ike Broflovski]] joining and are immediately jealous of him and his supposed intelligence, assuming he thinks he is superior to the rest of them. He later nominates Filmore for class president, citing him as the smarter kid in the  class. He tells [[Flora]], the last kindergartner who did not make a choice and the results ending in a tie to vote for Filmore.\n\nHe is among the students who recall sex positions when they are discussed in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\".\n\n[[Mr. Mackey]] casts him as a piece of candy for his school play about [[Tooth Decay]], as seen in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\".\n\nHe and Filmore are seen playing ball together in \"[[A Nightmare on Face Time]]\", and are later disturbed by [[Randy Marsh]] while streaming the adult-rated film ''Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers'' together.\n\nIn \"[[REHASH|#REHASH]]\" and \"[[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]]\" he can be seen as one of Ike's friends watching video game streaming services with him.\n\nIn \"[[Tegridy Farms]]\", Quaid tells Kyle to relax and \"try some gummy bear surprise\" after Kyle tells the kindergartners that vaping is bad for them, blowing smoke in his face.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nQuaid appears as one of the six kindergarteners who hides in [[Hide 'n' Seek]]. After the player finds him, he befriends them. His appearance changes a little in the game as his hair color is darker than in the series and his shoes are black.\n\n==Appearance==\nQuaid has brown curly hair. He wears a yellow shirt, under a pair of green overalls, and brown shoes.\n\n==Quotes==\n*'''Quaid:''' ''Relax, bitch.
