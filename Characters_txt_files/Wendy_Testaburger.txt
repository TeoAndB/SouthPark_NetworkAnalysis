She is a [[List of Female 4th Graders|student]] at [[South Park Elementary]]. She has been voiced by three people during the series' run: [[Mary Kay Bergman]], [[Eliza J. Schneider]], and currently [[April Stewart]]. She is the most prominent female character of the series.\n\n==Background==\n===Concept and Creation===\nHer name is said to be based on \"Wendy Westaburger\", the wife of one of [[Matt Stone]]'s friends.<ref>''Taking South Park Seriously'' By Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock. Publisher: SUNY Press, 2008, ISBN 0791475654/ISBN 9780791475652 Pages 8-9. Retrieved on April 17th, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Criminal Record===\nWendy has committed the following crimes throughout the series:\n*'''Assault and Battery/Disturbing the Peace:''' In \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\", she got into a fight with [[Eric Cartman]] on school grounds, seriously injuring him in the process.\n*'''Burglary:''' In \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\", she illegally entered the school at night to read Cartman's essay to find out whether or not he cheated. She narrowly avoided being caught by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].\n*'''Civil Unrest/Rioting:''' Participant and possible ringleader of the girls in South Park Elementary gender war in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\".\n*'''Murder for Hire:''' In \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\", she hired Iraqi soldiers to have substitute teacher [[Ms. Ellen]] kidnapped, loaded into a rocket, and fired directly at the sun, killing her. This was done in retaliation for Ellen ostensibly \"stealing\" Stan, Wendy's boyfriend, away, despite the fact that Ellen was a lesbian and thus had absolutely no romantic inclinations towards Stan; that, and Ms. Ellen is an adult whereas Stan is a child.\n*'''Sedition:''' In the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|movie]], she was a member of [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]], a group with the goal of stopping the execution of [[Terrance and Phillip]] by the government. However, she did it to save the world from being ruled by [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Satan]], so it can be justified.\n*'''Sexual Harassment (Alleged):''' In \"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\", she was sued by [[Craig Tucker]] for touching his thigh, and was forced to give him half of her belongings when the court ruled in his favor. However, given that this was one of a series of dubious sexual harassment suits around South Park, this charge is questionable at best.\n\n===Languages===\nIn \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\", Wendy is shown to be fluent in Arabic, using the language to talk to the agents she hired to launch [[Ms. Ellen]] into the sun.\n\nIn \"[[Chinpokomon]]\", Wendy becomes so engrossed in the new ''[[Chinpokomon (Brand)|Chinpokomon]]'' fad that she was able to confidently speak a [[Japan]]ese phrase.\n\n===Music===\nIn \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", she became a member of [[Eric Cartman]]'s \"boy band\" [[Fingerbang]], after wowing [[The Boys|the boys]] with a [[Wendy's Audition Song|song]] similar to the popular euphemistic \"Miss Susie\" rhyme.\n\nWendy also took part in the Thanksgiving musical play in \"[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\", she performed the opening song as well as several other duets with [[Bridon Gueermo]].\n\nIn ''[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics (Album)|Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]'', Wendy performs a duet with [[Stan Marsh]] entitled \"[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]\".\n\n===Ice Skating===\n''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' shows her with the rest of the third graders at [[Stark's Pond]], ice skating.[[File:Wendy_1.png|thumb|Ice skating at [[Stark's Pond]].]] During [[Wendy's Song|the song Stan has dedicated to her]], she is given a brief scene that displays a talent for skating, being able to perform a figure-eight, salchow, triple lutz, and twirl endlessly while keeping balance. None of the other children in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] have displayed this kind of ability, meaning that she might be the best ice skater in [[The Boys|the boys]]' class.\n\n===Physical Strength===\nWendy has shown herself to be a fairly decent fighter, beating up [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] after he repeatedly made jokes about Breast Cancer in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\". Although Cartman does manage to get a few hits in, Wendy turns the tide of the fight after ramming Cartman's face into a metal pole, multiple times, leaving Cartman lying in a pool of his own blood. The significance of this is debatable as Cartman has been shown to lose the majority of fights he gets in.\n\n===Politics===\nWendy is portrayed as very political. She has started and joined many campaigns, groups, and debates over the course of the show. She has also participated in stopping conspiracies and assassinations.\n\nIn ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', Wendy tries to save [[Terrance and Phillip]] from [[Mothers Against Canada|M.A.C.]] along with [[Gregory]], implores Stan to be more political, attempts to rally students to her cause, and later joins [[La Resistance (Organization)|La Resistance]].\n\nIn \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\", Wendy is infuriated when Cartman's report wins the school contest, instead of her report on protecting bottle-nosed dolphins. After reading his essay, she reveals to the public at Cartman's presentation with [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] that Cartman had copied ''Walden'' and replaced Henry David Thoreau's name with his own. Because Kathie Lee Gifford had already left at that point, nobody cared, further annoying her. In the meantime, Wendy and Stan tried to stop [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Mr. Hat]] from assassinating Kathie, although Mr. Hat ends up shooting at her, killing [[Kenny McCormick]] by mistake.\n\nIn \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\", she was one of a few people who realize why [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]] is upset about the [[South Park Flag]], and immediately volunteers to represent the \"Flag Should be Changed\" team for the upcoming debate, however, she was mortified to find out that her leading partner was Cartman. She attempts to lead the team without him and decides not to participate in discrediting [[Kyle Broflovski]] and Stan's team, who believed the flag should stay the way it was. They eventually begin to work together, and their partnership improves as they found that they had more and more things in common with each other, which leads to Wendy having a temporary crush on him. At the presentation, this attraction made it difficult for her to voice her side of the debate, causing her to kiss him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/355222|title=FAQ - South Park Studios|publisher=southparkstudios.com}}</ref> After that, she is able to concentrate, producing a well-rounded opinion on changing history.\n\nIn \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\", Wendy gives a speech to her [[The 4th Grade|class]], in order to raise awareness for breast cancer during the Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October). After Cartman's repeated derogatory remarks about breast cancer, Wendy beats Cartman up. Wendy was the class president of [[South Park Elementary]] until \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\", Wendy attempts to give a report on [[Syrian Refugee Children|Syrian refugees]] to her class, only to again be heckled by Cartman; his booing her became a running gag throughout the episode. She also spoke at a town meeting moderated by Kyle and Stan on \"murder porn\" and its ties to a real-life murder in town.\n\n===Voice Acting===\nFrom 1997 to 1999, Wendy Testaburger was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. Bergman listed Wendy among her five favorite roles in ''[[South Park]]'', (together with [[Liane Cartman]], [[Shelly Marsh]], [[Carol McCormick]], and [[Sheila Broflovski]]); stating that she admired the character's overall sweetness and intelligence, balanced by her unpredictability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wackyvoices.com/south.html|title=The Babes of South Park|publisher=www.wackyvoices.com|date=Retrieved on April 25, 2009.}}</ref> After Bergman's death in 1999, the character was temporarily voiced by [[Eliza J. Schneider]]; she is currently voiced by [[April Stewart]]. When Bergman first voiced Wendy, she had a sweet high voice, almost similar to Bergman's performance as Snow White from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', which she did from 1989 until her death in 1999. Wendy's voice changed little with Schneider, however, her voice was altered drastically with Stewart, to a much lower, more mature tone.\n\n==Appearance==\nWendy wears a pinkish-magenta beret, a light purple jacket with a navy blue trim, navy blue gloves, and yellow trousers. She also has peach skin like many of the characters, long black hair with choppy, uneven bangs. Under her jacket, she has been shown to be wearing a light purple tank-top in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", and a white tank top with a unicorn on it in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\". Wendy has only been seen without her beret in two episodes, \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\", where she took off her beret to dunk her head in her fishbowl, and \"[[Funnybot]]\", where she was seen dressed up without her beret.\n\nAs her transgender alter-ego \"Wendyl\" in \"[[The Cissy]]\", she kept her beret, but pinned back her hair and also wore a white t-shirt, denim vest, and light purple pants.\n\nIn the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', she wears a navy blue jacket over purple collared shirt and a navy blue skirt. She also wears a pair of glasses, gold earrings, and gold bead necklace. She does not wear her beret.\n\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Wendy Testaburger}}\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:Insheeption03.jpg|right|thumb|Wendy and Stan.]]\nWendy is best described as a mature and intelligent person whose stubbornness and occasional jealousy sometimes get the best of her; she is typically portrayed as nice, feminine, smart, and liberal in nature. In many episodes, she generally provides a voice of reason, usually against [[Eric Cartman]], especially in earlier seasons. She is generally friendly to others and seems well-liked at school, but she is unwilling to let her beliefs be compromised by popularity. Wendy is shown to be very intelligent and politically aware, writing an [[Weight Gain 4000|essay on the suffering of Bottlenose dolphins]], [[Pinkeye|donating candy to starving children in Nairobi]], being willing to [[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants|give Afghanistan children a dollar]], opposing [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|the American-Canadian War]], and doing a report on the [[Breast Cancer Show Ever|suffering of Breast Cancer patients]]. However, as the series, in general, became more political, Wendy's role as the politically aware voice of reason shrank, and by [[Season Five]] she was seldom seen as more than one of the [[List of Female 4th Graders|female students]]. In addition, [[Kyle Broflovski]] took over her duties as the most intelligent student in class and moral center.\n\n[[File:Rsz 1209breastcancershowever--1.png|thumb|left|180px|An enraged Wendy, in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\".]]\nWendy is a very empathic person and often concerned about those around her - she is the first of the girls at [[Heidi Turner]]'s slumber party to feel bad for making fun of [[Butters Stotch|Marjorine]] and she is the first and only student in the whole school to go after [[Tweek Tweak]] after he publicly stages a fake breakup with his [[Craig Tucker|boyfriend]] in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\". In addition, much of her political activities revolve around concern for others, such as children in Nairobi and Afghanistan, and Bottlenose Dolphins. Wendy also illustrates an adherence to rules and order - she refuses to step out of line against Cartman until given informal permission to attack him and exposed Cartman for cheating at the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest. In \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\", she was shown to have a strong motherly instinct; after hearing from [[Bebe Stevens]] about the way Stan had treated their egg, she was deeply worried that Stan would damage the egg which had belonged to Kyle and herself before [[Herbert Garrison|Ms. Garrison]] switched their partners. She even went over to Kyle's house, frantically asking to see the egg and hold it for a couple of minutes. After seeing how well Stan and Kyle took care of the egg and presented it to the Governor of Colorado at the end of the episode, she saw how good Stan's fathering skills were, and relaxed. Despite this, she has shown carelessness as well - in \"[[Pinkeye]]\", after initially planning a couples' dress as Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy she \"realized how stupid [they] would look\", and dressed as Chewbacca instead, not thinking about how it would affect Stan.\n\n[[File:Wendytr.png|180px|right|thumb|Wendy's eyes at the end of \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\".]]\nWendy will generally be kind to characters besides [[Eric Cartman]], but is prone to becoming antagonistic if she feels she has been wronged. Wendy almost always, however, attempts to resolve things peacefully before resorting to [[Breast Cancer Show Ever|violence]] or [[Dances with Smurfs|manipulation]]. When Cartman repeatedly berated her attempts to raise awareness for breast cancer, she initially tried to ignore him, before threatening to beat him up. Although Cartman initially agreed, he then tried to get out of it - they ended up having a brutal fight in front of the school. She also becomes somewhat jealous if she feels her relationship with Stan is in danger, but her exact reaction varies based on the situation. Besides her [[Tom's Rhinoplasty|famous encounter]] with [[Ms. Ellen]], wherein she hired [[Iraq]]is to shoot her into the sun, Wendy displayed jealousy when the boys obsessed over [[Bebe]]'s breasts and gossips about her with the other girls. She was also jealous of Stan's female Facebook friends in \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\". However, in other episodes, both during their relationship and during its hiatus, such as \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" she seems to have no problem with other girls flirting with Stan.\n\nWendy is very active in the school's extracurricular activities: aside from being class president, she is seen in \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" as one of three new members of the cheer squad (the others being [[Nichole]] and [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]]); she became its captain in \"[[The Hobbit]]\". In \"[[Cock Magic]]\", Wendy is shown as the captain of the girl's volleyball team.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Stan Marsh]]===\n[[File:WendyandStankissing.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Wendy and Stan, kissing in \"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\".]]\nFor the first seven seasons of the series, Wendy's most notable feature was her relationship with [[Stan Marsh]]. Their relationship began in the pilot episode \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\", where it was revealed that the two of them had been attracted for some time prior to the series. A recurring gag in the series involved Stan getting queasy from excitement whenever Wendy tried to kiss him (and in early episodes whenever she spoke to him) and then throwing up on her.\n\n[[File:111 wendy msellen.gif|180px|left|thumb|Wendy, warning [[Ms. Ellen]] to stay away from Stan in \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\".]]\nDespite Stan's continual vomiting, Wendy has so far stayed with him. She became extremely jealous when Ms. Ellen \"came between them\" in \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\". After Stan falls for [[Ms. Ellen]] and ignores Wendy's attempts to win back his love, Wendy pays a group of Iraqis a large sum of money to capture Ms. Ellen and shoot her into the sun. In the episode, \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", Wendy openly insults [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] after Stan (together with the [[List of Male 4th Graders|other boys]]) grows attracted to her developing breasts; this jealousy later extends to the point of her undergoing breast augmentation surgery to turn Stan's attention back to herself.\n\n[[File:Stan Vomits For Someone Else 0001.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Stan and Wendy sitting on a tree branch looking at the sunset; this was shown during a montage looking back at Wendy's relationship with Stan in \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\".]]\nThough they remained together until [[Season Seven]], their relationship did not seem as strong, and at times seemed strained (an example being the aforementioned \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\"). On Stan's part, though, it may have largely been because his adventures throughout the seasons left him too busy to pay attention to Wendy. She broke up with him in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Raisins]]\", although the only reason given was that she wanted to date [[Token Black]].\n\nEven after she had broken up with Stan, he still showed feelings for her and tried to win her back by playing Peter Gabriel's \"[[Shock the Monkey]]\" on his boombox on her lawn, though the plan failed when he saw that Token was in Wendy's room. In \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\", while working on the egg project, he tried to impress Wendy with his fathering abilities and grew jealous of [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] for working as the \"father\" of the same egg Wendy was the \"mother\" of. Near the end of the episode, Wendy complimented Stan on his \"fathering\" abilities, although due to Stan's bitterness, he rejected the complimenting, telling her that he \"didn't care what [she] thinks\".\n\n[[File:Wendy_4.png|thumb|right|Wendy and Stan holding hands in \"[[Super Fun Time]]\".]]\nIn \"[[The List]]\", Wendy helps Stan to discover that the girls' election of who the cutest and the ugliest boys in [[South Park Elementary]] was rigged. At the end of the episode, she admits to Stan that she enjoyed hanging out with him again, and they attempt to kiss, during which Stan throws up on her again. This is often seen as the \"re-ignition\" of their relationship.\n\nThis \"re-ignition\" was verified in the episode \"[[Super Fun Time]]\"; Stan pairs with Wendy on the field trip, telling the others that he is with his girlfriend, as well as fretting about the possibility of looking like a dork in front of her.\n\n[[File:Wendy_2.png|thumb|right|Wendy kissing Stan in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\".]] \nIn \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\", Wendy gave Stan a small kiss at her locker before walking away; this is notable as it was the first time Stan did not vomit thereafter. This may have been done because [[Trey Parker|Parker]] and [[Matt Stone|Stone]] were getting bored of the near-constant gag, similar to how they grew tired of [[Kenny's Deaths|killing Kenny]] after [[Season Five]].\n\nIn \"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\", when [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] attempted to recruit her into his \"kissing company\", Stan defended her heavily against Butters' advances.\n\nIn \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\", Stan heavily defends Wendy when she is being panned by Cartman.\n\nDespite a rather stable relationship in later seasons, Stan has managed to irritate Wendy on occasion. \n\n[[File:GlutenFreeEbola-00082.png|thumb|Wendy, with Stan, in \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\".]]\nIn \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", Wendy tells Stan to change his profile information on his newly created Facebook page to \"in a relationship\", as she was quite upset over it being listed as \"Single\". Later in the episode, she jealously mistook Stan's grandmother's friend, Susan, as a girl who was flirting with Stan by commenting that he looked cute in an unseen photo of a young Stan in a rabbit outfit.\n\nIn \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\", Wendy was infuriated when she learned that [[Eavesdropper]] had revealed a private e-mail Stan sent to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], in which he called another girl's butt crack \"hot\". In \"[[The Hobbit]]\", Wendy is angered at Stan when he suggests she gets a Photoshopped image of herself.\n\nIn \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\", Wendy joined the rest of the 4th-grade class in showing their displeasure toward him and [[The Boys|the boys]] after they were forced to return to school upon [[Go Fund Yourself|the failure of their start-up company]]. Stan broke up with her before the episode, citing his desire to put all his effort into the company, bragging that he'd be \"swimming in bitches\", but later regretted it. At the end of the episode, Wendy asks Stan to dance at the party, and he happily accepts her offer.\n\nDespite their disagreements, Wendy has continued to be a girlfriend to Stan, again showing her empathy towards those around her. For example, when she helped him break his \"hoarding\" habit in \"[[Insheeption]]\", citing that it would threaten their relationship.\n\nIn \"[[Ass Burgers]]\", Wendy approaches Kyle about Stan's new behavior problems. Wendy attempts to get Kyle's help to roust Stan out of his depression, but Kyle refuses to help.\n\n[[File:SkankHunt00042.png|thumb|right|Stan and Wendy's third breakup.]]\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", Wendy breaks up with Stan for the third time, due to the actions of internet troll [[Skankhunt42]]. This was because all of the girls believed Skankhunt42's actions spoke for the boys' opinions. However, she shows great reluctance and a bit of sorrow over doing so, as she voiced concern over the plan, and was coerced into doing so by Annie and Nichole.\n\nIn \"[[Oh, Jeez]]\", Stan, encouraged by [[Bill Clinton]] as part of his Gentlemen's Club program, attempts to apologize to Wendy in a restaurant, and get back together with her. This meetup ends abruptly, however, when Butters spots Stan from outside the restaurant, calls him a \"traitor\" for being with a girl, and presses his penis against the glass door - an act Cosby refers to as \"pressing pickle\". Despite this, ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'' implies that Stan and Wendy got back together, between the relationship chart made in the development of the game stating that they were dating, and the flirtatious dialogue between the two.\n\nSee also: \"[[Wendy's Song]]\" and \"[[Wake Up Wendy]]\", two love songs written by Stan.\n\n===Gregory of Yardale===\nIn ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', she had what seemed to be a crush on a newcomer named [[Gregory]]. She apparently liked him because he was very political, and shared many of her liberal opinions. After Stan followed the [[The Clitoris|Clitoris]]' advice and expressed confidence, she told Stan she had never really liked Gregory, even saying, ''\"Fuck Gregory! Fuck him right in the ear!\"''.\n\n===Eric Cartman===\n[[File:ChefGoesNanners082.png|thumb|left|Wendy kissing Cartman in \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\".]]\nWendy is one of the stronger examples of an [[Eric Cartman]] hater, but in the [[Season Four]] episode, \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\", she had a temporary crush on him while they were working together on the flag debate. She even dreamed of herself and Cartman falling in love together in a meadow. Frightened by these feelings, she consulted Bebe for help on the matter, and Bebe told her that it was probably just sexual tension caused by working for so long beside him. Upon her advice, Wendy passionately kissed Cartman at the presentation the next day. After that, she lost all her positive and negative feelings for him, even seeming to consider him a friend.\n\nHer hatred for him returned eight seasons later, in the episode \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\", where she fought him, and beat him up after he mocks breast cancer several points in the episode.\n\nIn \"[[The Cissy]]\", outraged by Cartman's manipulation of transgenders to use first the girl's bathroom, then get his own private bathroom. She cut her hair, wore jeans, and called herself Wendell to get back at Cartman and use his bathroom, pissing him off.\n\n===Token Black===\nIn \"[[Raisins]]\", after Wendy broke up with Stan, she began dating [[Token Black]]. Their relationship likely did not last long, as Token was seen with other girls in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\". They were, however, shown riding a Ferris wheel together in \"[[The Jeffersons]]\". Afterward, they rarely interacted and were not seen together, so they probably had an off-screen breakup.\n\nDespite their lack of interaction nowadays, in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\", Wendy tells [[Nichole Daniels]] that her supposed crush, Token, is really nice and that she [[Raisins|dated him for a while]], meaning that they might still be friends after their breakup.\n\n===Bridon Gueermo===\n[[Bridon Gueermo]] is a third-grader who Wendy and the [[List of Female 4th Graders|other girls]] had a crush on in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\". Wendy and Bridon performed many duets throughout the episode, causing Stan to become jealous. However, Wendy assured him that she would never leave him for Bridon because he could be with any girl he wanted.\n\n===Kyle Broflovski===\n﻿Kyle and Wendy worked together in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\". Wendy complimented Kyle's parenting skills, and, in the same episode, Kyle comforted her when she was missing her egg. In \"[[The List]]\", Wendy helps Kyle get the real list. Wendy also helps Kyle find [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] in \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\". In \"[[Ass Burgers]]\", Kyle and Wendy talk about Stan, and two boys say \"Those two should just screw and get it over with.\"\n\n===Butters Stotch===\n[[File:Wendy_3.png|thumb|220x220px|Wendy and Butters' bitterness for one another in \"[[The Hobbit]]\"]]\nWendy and Butters are typically just neutral, but when they have rare interactions it is never good. In \"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\", Wendy angrily attempts to fend off Butters' attempts at persuading her to join his company after he calls her a \"bitch\". Stan Marsh intervenes, to get him to leave her alone. He also led a rebellion against her in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\", which resulted in Butters peeing on the side of her [[Testaburger Residence|home]].\n\nIn \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\", Wendy and Cartman plan to fight after school, and Butters originally starts out as Cartman's biggest supporter and said he wanted Cartman to \"Kick her [Wendy's] ass!\" however when the fight actually begins Butters has a change of heart and eggs Wendy on along with the entire school while she gives Cartman the beating of his life and shouts \"Fuck him up, Wendy!\".\n\nIn \"[[Marjorine]]\", Wendy is among the students who did not seem to care that Butters had seemingly died.\n\nTheir relationship reached its boiling point in \"[[The Hobbit]]\" after Butters rejected Wendy's friend, [[Lisa Berger]], by calling her \"fat\". Enraged at Butters for hurting her friend's feelings, Wendy slams Butters' locker shut and calls him an asshole. Butters admits that while Lisa seems like a nice girl, she is too overweight for him, he says he likes [[Kardashians|Kim Kardashian]] because she is beautiful. Wendy rolls up Butters' picture of Kim and throws it on the floor then storms off, but not before threatening to tell [[Mr. Mackey]] about what Butters \"said to that poor girl.\" In Mr. Mackey's office, Wendy expects Butters to be in trouble but is baffled when she finds out that Mr. Mackey sides with Butters. Later in the episode, Wendy seemed to want to make peace with Butters, she politely invites him to the computer lab so she could show him how easy it is for women to photoshop images of themselves by photo-shopping an image of Lisa. He, however, mistakes that for a legitimate image of her and feels regretful for rejecting her then leaves the room.\n\n===Bebe Stevens===\n[[File:FollowThatEgg20.jpg|thumb|Wendy with Bebe and Kyle in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\".]] Wendy is best friends with [[Bebe Stevens]]. They have assisted each other at various times throughout the series. In \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\", Bebe gave Wendy a makeover to help her impress [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], as she thought [[Ms. Ellen]] was trying to take him from her. In \"[[Clubhouses]]\", Wendy unsuccessfully attempted to help Bebe begin dating Kyle.\n\nThough they seem to be very close friends, they have had a fair share of issues. In \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", Wendy becomes jealous of Bebe because she had become popular among the boys due to her developing breasts. However, Wendy was not the only girl to become jealous, as she was seen insulting Bebe behind her back with several other girls. Later, despite [[Mrs. Testaburger|her mother]]'s concerns, she got breast implants, presumably in order to outdo Bebe, only for her to arrive too late when the boys in class got over Bebe's breasts due to her wearing a cardboard box over her chest, causing the boys to laugh at Wendy's breast implants and call her a \"stupid bitch\".\n\nIn the episode, \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", Wendy left the party as she felt the stupid spoiled whore game was demeaning to girls and did not want to be a part of it.\n\nIn \"[[The List]]\", Bebe and Wendy get into a fight after arguing over the list of the cutest and ugliest boys. Nevertheless, they were shown to still be friends in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\". Their friendship still appears to remain alive today, as they've been shown together in the popular girls' clique in numerous instances. In addition, Bebe has a photograph of her and Wendy smiling together hung on her bedroom wall, as shown in \"[[Cartman Finds Love]]\" and \"[[Skank Hunt]]\".\n\n===Other Girls===\nWendy acts as the leader of the female \"population\". The other girls look up to her as their voice of reason, though on some occasions, they ignore her suggestions. The most notable exception however was during \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", in which Wendy, failing to grasp the trend of being a whore, was outcast from the girls.\n\nIn \"[[The List]]\", [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] threatened her with a gun after finding out she knew about the forged list.\n\nWendy used the girls as hypothetical examples in railing against using Photoshop to \"improve\" women's looks in \"[[The Hobbit]]\". The girls misconstrued her remarks and thus labeled her a \"hater\", much to Wendy's frustration and eventual dejection.\n\n===Other Boyfriends===\nIn \"[[Clubhouses]]\", it is suggested that Wendy had boyfriends before Stan, but the number of boyfriends or who they may have been is unknown. In the episode, after Wendy suggests coming over to play Truth or Dare in Stan's clubhouse, Stan tells Wendy that he does not have a clubhouse. Wendy replies ''\"You don't?

Since the New Kid cannot talk, [[Annie Nelson|Annie]] tells her for him. Wendy says that she and the girls will play with the boys until he does a favor for her. They are under the suspicion that [[Monica Ryland]] is a two-faced bitch, but need the New Kid to pose as Bebe's boyfriend to find out for himself.\n\nWhen that quest is over, Wendy gives the New Kid a new quest to check the abortion records over at the clinic to see who the two-faced bitch really is. To make the New Kid go undercover, as a girl, they give him a makeover. The New Kid then enters the abortion clinic and checks to see the records.\n\nHe then shows the records to Wendy, but it turns out that they were written in another language. The final quest she gives is to get them translated. He then shows the records to [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and the others at the [[Elven Kingdom]]. Cartman tells everyone that he's seen this language before, in [[Canada|the Kingdom to the North]], and the New Kid heads over there to get the records translated by the [[Minister of Montreal]].\n\nWhen all of that is over, Wendy and the girls read the translated document and find out that they belong to [[Nancy Turner]], showing that the two-faced bitch was really [[Heidi Turner]]. Wendy and the girls soon forgive Heidi, thank the New Kid for serving them well, and agree to join the boys in fighting [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]].\n\nDuring the fight, she gets injured and the New Kid summons Butters to help heal her. Wendy then rewards him with a Superhero Badge.\n====Facebook Messages====\n[[File:Wendy facebook message.png|700px]]\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"120\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nWendyadvcard.png|'''[[Captain Wendy]]'''\nWendyscicard.png|'''[[Ice Sniper Wendy]]'''\nWendymyscard.png|'''[[Angel Wendy]]'''\nWendyfancard.png|'''[[Shieldmaiden Wendy]]'''\nWendySupCard.png|'''[[Call Girl (Phone Destroyer)|Call Girl]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n[[File:JesusVsSanta16.jpg|thumb|right|Wendy's debut.]]\n*\"[[The Spirit of Christmas|The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa]]\" - Wendy is seen sitting on [[Santa]]'s lap.\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Wendy helps the boys recover Kyle's kidnapped brother [[Ike Broflovski]], and becomes Stan's girlfriend.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - Wendy's first appearance after the Christmas shorts.
