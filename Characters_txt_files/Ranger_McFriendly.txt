After informing the [[City People|townsfolk]] of the smug, he forces Stan to destroy all the hybrids by himself, just in time for the smug storm to have the least impact on the town.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears the standard park ranger's uniform: tan hat, beige button-up shirt, and taupe pants. He also has a badge near his left shoulder, as well as a utility belt on his waist.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Ranger McFriendly\">\nSmugAlert085.png|Ranger McFriendly after punching [[Stan Marsh]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe is quite mean, contrary to his name, although his attitude was justified considering the danger Stan unintentionally put South Park in. Although, it is debatable if punching Stan was also justified, or further confirming his spitefulness. He is also very forceful, making Stan destroy all the hybrid cars by himself despite his small stature, and age.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n[[zh:麦克弗兰德利护林员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
