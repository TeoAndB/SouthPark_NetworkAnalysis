He later appears as a friend of [[Douchebag]]'s in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Grey Dawn]]\" Pete's possible grandparents are seen killing a fisherman because they turn their vehicle on a bridge to get back to [[Country Kitchen Buffet]]. While turning their car, they drop from the bridge on the fisherman. The reporter mentioned their names as Pete and Lynda Melman.\n\nIn \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\", he pooped his pants during social studies. Consequently, he had to go to the nurse's office and phone his mother for a fresh pair of jeans and underwear. This story was then widely publicized on the website [[Eavesdropper]], making him the subject of intense ridicule by other students at [[South Park Elementary]]. It is implied he later became suicidal.\n\n==Appearance==\nPete has blond hair and wears a white t-shirt with black hemming. The only known visual representation of Pete is from the front-page of [[Eavesdropper]], though his hair color is mentioned in dialogue. He makes a physical appearance in the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', hiding in Clyde's garage, though only his torso and head are visible as the rest of him is obscured by a wall.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''==\n[[File:The_Stick_of_Truth;Pete_Melman.png|thumb|225px|Pete in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth''.]]\nHe can be found hiding in Clyde's garage. When he discovers that a new kid moved to South Park, who he quickly befriends, happy that there is a kid in town who knows nothing about him. He also asks the New Kid not to believe any rumors about him on Facebook.\n\nPete is also seen in an early temp version of the game where he and [[Mike|Mike Cooper]] are said by [[Nelly]] to be whispering to each other and stopping when she came near. This could conclude the two minor characters as friends and also point out that they may not like Nelly. \n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" - Seen attacking [[Wendy]]'s house with [[Butters Stotch|Butters]].\n*\"[[Bass to Mouth]]\" - Publicly humiliated on Eavesdropper following a bowel accident. He is only mentioned in this episode.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[es:Pete Melman]]\n[[zh:皮特·梅尔曼]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
