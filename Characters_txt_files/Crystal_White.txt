She first appears in the [[Season Twenty-One]] finale episode, \"[[Splatty Tomato]]\".\n\n==Background==\nShe becomes terrified of [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] and believes he is going to 'get her', much to the irritation and concern of her conservative parents who think that the school's liberal views were to blame for giving their daughter night terrors.\n\n==Personality==\nUnlike her brother and mother, Crystal is quite talkative, taking after her father. She can be quite nervous, particularly when it comes to her fear of President Garrison. She goes along with her parents' Republican and QAnon proceedings, and repeats some of their beliefs, though she does not seem very interested in them. She can also be quite a tattletale when she told her dad that Alejandro is being defiant and disobedient to his adoptive family as shown from \"[[Season Finale]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nCrystal is a kindergartener with light, pale brown pigtails and golden star barrettes. She wears a pink t-shirt with a smiling yellow kitten on it and purple shorts. When she goes to bed, she wears a dark blue onesie with pink hoops and trimmings and a white kitten head on the left chest.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Splatty Tomato]]\" - Screams and cries when Garrison stalks her window.\n*\"[[Season Finale]]\" - She is seen along with her family.\n*\"[[Basic Cable]]\" - Seen in the Blacks vs. Whites series on Amazon Prime Video.\n*\"[[Christmas Snow]]\" - Seen with her parents in the car.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Supporter of [[Tutornon]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-One}}\n[[fr:Crystal White]]\n[[ja:クリスタル・ホワイト]]\n[[pl:Crystal White]]\n[[zh:克莉斯托·怀特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Kindergartners]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
