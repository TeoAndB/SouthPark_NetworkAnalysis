When the general says they could turn him into a weapon, the scientist says that turning the robot into a weapon is unethical. Later on, he discovers that A.W.E.S.O.M.-O has \"developed consciousness\", not knowing that he is a real boy. The military general orders the scientist to erase A.W.E.S.O.M-O's memory. Later, he attempts to get A.W.E.S.O.M.-O out of the pentagon, but is shot in the stomach by one of the military soldiers. As [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] shows up to protect A.W.E.S.O.M.-O, the scientist pulls out some of his organs, resulting in his death.\n\nThough he is unnamed, he is repeatedly and mockingly referred to as \"Mr. Scientist\" by the military general.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe scientist has short light brown hair and light brown eyebrows. He wears a white lab coat over a sky blue shirt with his name tag on the left side as well as a black belt, blue pants, black shoes, and black glasses.  \n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Mr. Scientist\">\nAO (64).png|The scientist talking in the Pentagon.\nAO (83).png|The scientist talking to [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]].\nAO (95).png|\"Damn you all to hell!\"\nAO (105).png|The scientist with his organs exposed as he dies.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:科学家先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
