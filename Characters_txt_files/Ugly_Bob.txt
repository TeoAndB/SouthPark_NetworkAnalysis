In America, Bob is not considered ugly. He is just considered Canadian.\n\nHe still wears a paper bag over his head and now also wears a jacket. He runs into [[Ike Broflovski]] on his way to the Canadian call to arms. They join with the other Canadians to confront [[Scott the Dick]] who is now a giant, but find out that he did not kidnap the Princess. He and Ike join Scott after the real culprits, suspecting a group of Eskimos, but they quickly discover Scott is incorrect. Luckily, the Eskimos lead them to the true and final culprit - [[Tooth Decay]]. Bob is instrumental in his defeat, as Ike exposing Bob's face to the creature freezes and kills it. He is given a Canadian Medal of Honor by the Princess.\n\n==Appearance==\nHis face has been described as one in which \"somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver\". He wears green pants and an orange, long-sleeved shirt. His shirt, like [[Terrance and Phillip]]'s and [[Scott the Dick]]'s shirts, has his name's first initial embroidered on it, however, his is in lowercase. Terrance and Phillip advise him to wear a paper bag over his head. In \"[[Royal Pudding]]\" he was seen wearing a brown jacket and a grey colored paper bag.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Ugly Bob\">\nTerrancePhillipInNotWithoutMyAnus80.png|Ugly Bob wearing a paper bag in \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\".\nRoyalPudding24.png|Ugly Bob unmasked in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\".\nTerrancePhillipInNotWithoutMyAnus19.png|Another picture of him unmasked\n</gallery>\n\n==Interactions==\n===Celine Dion===\nIn \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\", Ugly Bob takes Terrance and Phillip's advice of wearing the paper bag over his head. [[Celine Dion]], who, in the show, had been married to but divorced Terrance, fell for him and they had sex with each other. She does not yet know about his true appearance, because he wore the bag over his head at all times to help hide the fact that he is actually hideously ugly, and refers to him as \"Handsome Bob\".\n\nTerrance, meanwhile, had rescued the [[Sally Dion|daughter]] he had had with Celine during their marriage, and he wants to start a life with her again. When he finds out about her new relationship, he pulls the bag off of Bob's head, revealing his true appearance to her. She screams in horror, but decides to stay with Bob nonetheless, on the condition that he keeps the bag over his head at all times. Later, it is discovered that he had impregnated Celine, and they both hope that the baby would turn out to look like Celine.\n\n===Terrance and Phillip===\nUgly Bob is friends with Terrance and Phillip enough that they will talk to him despite his horrific deformity, which only Canadians can apparently see. Terrance and Phillip are the ones to suggest that Ugly Bob start wearing a paper bag on his head to avoid people knowing how ugly he is, though they do so mockingly. Ugly Bob is insulted for his appearance by Terrance and Phillip.\n\n===Ike Broflovski===\nMeets Ike on a bus. He does not know that there are other Canadians living in the U.S.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is revealed in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\" that Ugly Bob is from Toronto.\n*Ugly Bob has the third longest absence from the show (13 years). The longest belongs to [[Doctor Tom]] who did not having a speaking appearance for twenty years, and second longest for [[Starvin' Marvin (Character)|Starvin' Marvin]] who was absent for eighteen years. He is tied with the [[Recess Supervisor|recess supervisor]].\n*Ugly Bob has become so hideous since acquiring his paper bag that he now turns people to stone upon sight, similar to Medusa, a monster in Greek mythology.\n*When Ugly Bob first receives his paper bag from Terrance and Phillip, it had no eye holes. He later made eye holes so he could see.\n*Ugly Bob understands the Native Canadian language.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\" - Gets a paper bag on his head later he is sleeping with [[Celine Dion]].\n*\"[[Royal Pudding]]\" - Helps Ike to save the Canadian Princess.\n*\"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\" (cameo) - He can be heard on Cartman's television.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n\n[[es:Feo Bob]]\n[[it:Orrendo Bob]]\n[[ja:ぶさいくボブ]]\n[[zh:丑鲍勃]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
