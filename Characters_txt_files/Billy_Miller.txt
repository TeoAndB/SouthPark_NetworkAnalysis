He hires [[Eric Cartman]] so that he can repay his debt for some popcorn chicken he ate. Soon after sending him to set up a deal with [[Colonel Sanders]], he is overthrown by Cartman. The Colonel sends his goons to kill Cartman and his group, but Cartman manages to escape just as the police arrive and engage in a shootout with the Colonel's men. While trying to escape, Billy's mother gets shot in the crossfire.\n\n==Appearance==\nBilly has short black hair, wears a red shirt with a bulldozer depicted on it, dark blue pants, and white shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nBilly has a very business-like personality and seems to understand what it means to be trafficking chicken. He seems to prefer solving problems, such as debt, in a business-like way and is shocked by Cartman's ridiculous order of 10,000 boxes of chicken. He releases that he \"can't move that kind of chicken\", acting like a stereotypical drug lord, even saying \"I'm not making any money here, I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass and I have to hire these sorters to get the chicken ready for distribution!\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n[[es:Billy Miller]]\n[[fr:Billy Miller]]\n[[zh:比利·米勒]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"
