He was first mentioned in \"[[Cartmanland]]\" and made his first appearance in the episode \"[[Imaginationland]]\", he later appears in \"[[200]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Cartmanland]]\", after [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s parents tell him the story of [[Job (Biblical Character)|Job]], he reflects on the fact that [[God]] killed all of Job's children and that Michael Bay still gets to keep making movies, causing him to lose all his faith in God.\n\nWhen the United States government asks assorted Hollywood directors for ideas on how to defeat the terrorists who have invaded [[Imaginationland]], Michael Bay is amongst those selected. To the relief of the government officials interviewing them, he claims to have an idea that could help. He suggests they design massive CGI buildings that explode, 18-wheelers spinning uncontrollably, and motorcycles that flip over helicopters, only to explode, with him making obnoxious sound effects.\n\nWhen he is told that those are not ideas, but rather just special effects, he replies \"I don't understand the difference\", leaving the officials with no solutions to the terrorist threat.\n\nBay appears again, in a cameo role in \"[[200]]\", in which [[Tom Cruise]] organized 200 [[celebrities]], in filing a class-action lawsuit against the town of [[South Park]] for years of mockery and abuse.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has unusually red-colored skin (a joke about the orange filter used in the ''Transformers'' movies), dirty blond hair, and, beard stubble. He wears a grey suit with light blue trims.\n\n==Quotes==\n*{{quote|Michael Bay|We start by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH!
