The coach refuses, and he \"serves\" Randy so badly that he ends up in the hospital. Later on in the episode at the competition, one of [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' tap dancing shoes comes off and hits a row of stage lights, causing them to fall and crush the crew and the coach to death.\n\nDespite his death, his character model is reused in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode \"[[World War Zimmerman]]\" as one of the angry African Americans in [[Eric Cartman]]'s nightmare.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe coach has short flat black hair, black eyebrows, and a large mustache. He wears a purple and yellow outfit, white and yellow sneakers, and a round white earring on his right ear.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of The Orange County Crew Coach\">\nYGFITA-Coach-Dancing.png|The coach dancing.\nYGFITA-Coach-Serves-Randy.png|The coach \"serving\" Randy.\nYGFITA-Coach-Before-Death.png|The coach right before his death.\nOrangeCountyCrew-WorldWarZimmerman.png|The coach's cameo in \"[[World War Zimmerman]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[zh:奥兰治县舞队教练]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
