Immediately after, Jessica shows up, saying hello to them. They say hello back and act friendly to her, but [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] calls her a skank after she leaves. She then will immediately give The New Kid a friend request as he enters the clinic.\n\n==Appearance==\nJessica has long brown hair and the same thin black eyebrows as most other child characters. She wears a red top, a red skirt, black shoes, and a small white earring on each ear.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Jessica Rodriguez\">\nSPTSOT-Jessica-Rodriguez.png|Jessica saying hello to the other girls.\nSPTSOT-Jessica-Rodriguez-FR.png|Jessica giving The New Kid a friend request.\n</gallery>\n\n==Facebook Message==\n[[File:Jessie rodriguez facebook message.png|700px]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:杰西卡·罗德里格斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Female 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by April Stewart]]\n[[Category:Video Game Exclusive characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
