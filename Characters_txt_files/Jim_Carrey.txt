He appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode, \"[[You're Getting Old]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCarrey's new movie, ''Mr. Popper’s Penguins'', seemed to have a terrible comedy plot, according to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] as he watched the film preview at the cinema. Carrey had no speaking role but rather danced around with penguin-shaped pieces of feces.\n\n==Appearance==\nCarrey has brown hair and eyebrows and was seen dressed in a blue shirt and black pants. Despite being a Canadian American, he was not drawn with Canadian features, likely to make more him recognizable.\n\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[es:Jim Carrey]]\n[[zh:金·凯瑞]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
