He appeared in the episode, \"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Eric Cartman]] fakes Tourette's Syndrome, he writes to Dateline's Chris Hansen to do a show about his 'illness', with the intent of simply spouting off as many hateful and politically incorrect things as he can think of. Hansen agrees to the idea, switching from catching pedophiles to talking about Tourette's. However, when Cartman truly begins to lose control of what he's able to say and not say, he goes to Hansen to call off the show and attempts to leave. Hansen stops him by simply saying his catchphrase, \"have a seat\", which seems to result in a low-level mind-control, forcing Cartman to obey. Hansen then informs Cartman that the latter will be on the show. With Cartman seated, he went on to add how a pedophile, named Louis Conradt, refused to appear on ''To Catch a Predator'' and then \"shot himself\". Hansen says that unless Cartman does the show, he might end up \"shooting himself\" just like the pedophile. Cartman subsequently urinates his pants in fear.\n\nThe show starts, but before Cartman can be brought out, a massive group of pedophiles sent in by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Thomas]] arrive and, upon seeing Hansen, begin to shoot themselves in the head. Hansen rushes out to find Thomas and accuses him of being the cause of the shootings. He attempts to use his \"have a seat\" catchphrase on the boy, but he is immune, and shouts profanities back at Hansen who cries out, \"I'm telling\", as he runs off.\n\nHansen appears again in the episode, \"[[Britney's New Look]]\" where he watched Britney's terrible opening performance.\n\n==Appearance==\nChris Hansen has combed light brown hair and trimmed, light brown eyebrows. He wears a black suit with a teal shirt and a blue tie.\n\n==Personality==\nIn the scope of the show, he has a speech impediment and has particular difficulty with saying his own name. This is a jab at the real Hansen by the show's creators.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Chris Hansen\">\nLePetitTourette057.png|Hansen using his \"Have a seat...\" technique to force Cartman to sit down in \"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\".\nLePetitTourette079.png|Hansen being called an \"Asshole-licking dick-fart\" by [[Thomas]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\" - Hosts ''To Catch a Predator''.\n*\"[[Britney's New Look]]\" (cameo)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[fr:Chris Hansen]]\n[[zh:克里斯·汉森]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]"
