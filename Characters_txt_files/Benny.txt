"{{South Park character\n|name = Benny\n|image = Benny.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Brown\n|job = Bank Teller\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397941/|title=Margaritaville on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Margaritaville]]\"\n}}\n'''Benny''' is the bank teller at the [[Bank of South Park]], who appears in \"[[Margaritaville]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Margaritaville]]\", [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] go to the South Park Bank, so Stan can learn to save his money. Stan gives Benny $100 to save. Benny explains how insurance works before suddenly announcing \"It's gone\". The teller then tells him to move aside for people who actually have money. This happens with 2 people after.\n\n==Appearance==\nBenny wears a black suit, a white shirt and a blue and white striped tie. He also has brown hair.\n\n==Personality==\nBenny is uncaring to his customers, when he loses their money, he does not offer any condolences, and simply pushes them aside.\n\nWhen people approach Benny and ask him to put their money to work, Benny puts their money in high-risk ventures without asking them, getting signatures or giving any alternatives, which in real life would get him fired.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nBenny is seen when [[The New Kid]] goes to the bank. He can invest money, but Benny then loses it instantly as he did in Margaritaville. Once you have the shrinking power, you can go through a well-hidden hole in the bank and fight the Bank Teller.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nThe New Kid, with [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], go to Benny at the bank to get a loan for the Chaos Minions. This time without even asking, Benny puts the New Kid's house up as collateral for the loan without asking or getting anything signed, and instantly loses it, to Professor Chaos' horror, again reflecting the scene in \"[[Margaritaville]]\".\n\nA random Wheel of Fortune-style game then starts, similar to the scene in Margaritaville which shows how the economy works with a beheaded chicken. The New Kid can play this game as many times as they like. After the New Kid is of a sufficient economic class, you can take a selfie with Benny.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[fr:Benny]]\n[[zh:本尼]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Enemies]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
