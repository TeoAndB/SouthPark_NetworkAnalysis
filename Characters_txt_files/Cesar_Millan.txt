He appears in the [[Season Ten]] episode, \"[[Tsst]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCesar is hired by [[Liane Cartman]] to help improve [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] behavior. Unlike the assorted nannies who were hired to discipline Cartman (all of whom were destroyed - mentally or emotionally - by him), Cesar's approach proves to be the most successful, as he treats Cartman like a dog, rather than a human being. Mrs. Cartman becomes so grateful for his help that she begins propositioning Cesar for a deeper relationship. When Cesar reminds her that she is just his client, and that he is merely there to teach her to control Cartman and then leaves, she backpedals on the training, causing Cartman to regress into his evil tendencies.\n\n==Appearance==\nCesar Millan was shown with a spiky gray hair with a hairstyle, black eyebrows, a black goatee, and some warts on his face. He wears a dark blue jacket with two pockets and up sleeves, beige pants, and black shoes. He has a tall head and appears to be physically strong, as he handles dogs.\n\n==Personality==\nUnlike almost all celebrities that appeared in ''South Park'', Cesar's depiction was not disrespected in any way. In fact, he was shown in a very positive light, having been the only person able to manipulate and control Eric Cartman's behavior, to the point of causing him to temporarily behave like a rational human being.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Cesar is one of the few celebrities on ''South Park'' not to be made fun of for a certain trait or a racial or stereotypical joke about his race, unlike several other celebrities and characters on the show (although Cartman disrespects him by calling him \"Mexican\" in a rude tone and insults him once by calling him a \"Taco Vendor\").\n**Although, Cartman's criticism of Cesar's training tactics (and/or general disdain of Cesar, his ethnicity aside) might have been an unintentional precursor to later real-life criticisms of Cesar's methods, which surfaced as early as January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/23621109/ruff-treatment|title=Ruff Treatment|publisher=EBSCO Host Connection}}</ref>\n*Cesar himself reacted to his own portrayal in the episode on a [[YouToob|YouTube]] video and that commented that his depiction was very accurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjauXCyVjw|title=Reacting To My Own South Park Episode!|publisher=Cesar Millan on YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n[[de:Cesar Millan]]\n[[es:César Millán]]\n[[fr:Cesar Millan]]\n[[zh:西萨·米兰]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
