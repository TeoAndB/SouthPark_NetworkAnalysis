He is generally used as a background character.\n\n==Background==\nHis only major role was in his debut episode, \"[[Pre-School]]\", where he and the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] promise to defend [[The Boys|the boys]] from [[Trent Boyett]] if they bring a photo of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mother]]'s boobs. The boys then bring the photo (which was actually a photo of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ass) and the 6th graders try to fight Trent but end up failing.\n\n==Personality==\nNot much is known about his personality. It can be assumed that he behaves the same as the other 6th graders, like spending time bullying younger children. Like the other 6th graders, he is also not very smart, as he thought the photo the boys brought was really a photo of [[Sharon Marsh]]'s breasts.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is a tall 6th grader with dirty blond hair with a strange hairstyle and wears a yellow long-sleeved shirt, brown pants, and black shoes.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the 6th Grader with Yellow Shirt and Brown Pants\" widths=\"160\">\nPreSchool46.png|He along with the other 6th graders seeing a fake photo of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s breasts.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Pre-School]]\" - Debut.\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" - Seen in the Gymnasium.\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of [[Heidi Turner|Heidi's]] bedroom.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of Heidi's bedroom.\n[[zh:黄衣棕裤六年级生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:6th graders]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
