She suggests Larry can make his own decisions which would deter other children bullying him at school. Larry sees this as an act of bravery and begins trying to win the acceptance of Shelly.\n\nAs their friendship grows, Larry takes off his life vest, then he and Shelly go on a date to see the Broadway musical \"[[Wicked]]\" in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Shelly's father, [[Randy Marsh]], to save his daughter from acting on the \"subliminal subtext\" behind the play, he interrupts the performance dressed as Spider-Man. He causes panic by accidentally breaking the water pipes thus flooding the theater. Ironically, Larry drowns due to him not wearing the life vest.\n\n==Appearance==\nLarry is overweight, so much that his stomach bulges out of his shirt. He has blond hair and rosy cheeks and wears a striped yellow and turquoise shirt with a pair of blue jeans. He used to constantly wear a life vest around his neck, but he takes it off for Shelly. When he and Shelly go on their date, he wears a tuxedo and a purple bow tie. Whilst swimming, he wears purple swimming trunks.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Larry Feegan\">\nBroadwayBroDown019.png|Larry eating with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Feegan.\nBroadwayBroDown036.png|Larry visiting Shelly.\nBroadwayBroDown055.png|Larry playing ''[[List of Video Game References#The Settlers of Catan|The Settlers of Catan]]'' with [[Shelly Marsh|Shelly]] in \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\".\nBroadwayBroDown071.png|Larry and Shelly Marsh enjoying a Broadway musical as a couple.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nLarry is very timid and lacks self-confidence. This is evident when he is afraid to jump off the diving board, and when Shelly speaks up to his parents about letting him decide if he wants to be a vegan. With that support, he plucks up the courage to disobey his parents by eating a Slim Jim and later at Burger King. Despite being very afraid, he also approaches Shelly and forms a budding relationship with her. He is shy and socially awkward, evidenced by the fact that he gets bullied in school and tells Shelly that it is the first time anyone ever stood up for him.\n\n==Family==\n===Parents===\nLarry's parents are overprotective and force him to wear a life vest, even on dry land. Their habit of wearing life vests all the time indicates that they are likely Survivalists.  His father is a bully who is overly preachy in his beliefs in veganism and has forced Larry to be a vegan since he was born. It is evident that Larry is afraid of his parents and does not dare to question them. However, [[Mrs. Feegan|his mother]] appears to be nicer and more open-minded than her husband, as she decides to take a chance allowing Larry to leave his life vest off later on.\n\n==Interactions==\n===Shelly Marsh===\nShelly reluctantly accepts Larry as a friend, until he sings her a [[Out of My Shell|song]] about how she inspired him to overcome the fears of his parents and make his own food choices. After removing his life vest, Shelly invites Larry to play ''[[List of Video Game References#The Settlers of Catan|The Settlers of Catan]]'' on Xbox 360.\n\nShelly is actually crying when after the show was ruined and she finds out that Larry has died.\n\n==Trivia==\n*His last name is a rhyming joke for vegan as his family is practicing a vegan lifestyle. He is derogatorily called \"Feegan the Vegan\" by Cartman.\n*Larry is overweight, despite that his father is shown to be muscular and his mother is shown to be slim.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[es:Larry Feegan]]\n[[ja:ラリー・フィーガン]]\n[[zh:拉里·费根]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Teens]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
