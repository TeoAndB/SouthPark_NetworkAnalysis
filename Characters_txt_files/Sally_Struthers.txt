She first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhen the government authorities mistake [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] for a starving African child and send him to Ethiopia, he discovers Sally Struthers is hoarding snacks in a small building. As the episode progresses, Sally eats more and more food and eventually becomes huge. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] erroneously states that Sally Struthers was on ''Full House''.\n\nIn the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]\", she eventually appears to look like Jabba the Hutt from the ''Star Wars'' movies.\n\nShe is also referenced in the [[Season Nine]] episode, \"[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]\", in an incident referred to as the \"Sally Struthers Incident\", which of course is referencing the episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\nShe returns in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, \"[[200]]\", where she is back to the way she was in \"Starvin Marvin\". She is frozen by [[Joseph Smith]] in the following episode, \"[[201]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nShe is obscenely overweight in \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" and \"[[201]]\" and she resembles Jabba the Hutt in \"[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Sally Struthers\">\nStarvinMarvininSpace076.png|Sally as Jabba the Hutt in \"[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]\".\n200_07.jpg|Sally in \"[[200]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Sally Struthers was said to be a fan of South Park until her portrayal in \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\", which she was very upset and offended by. Despite this, [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] have not said they have anything against her personally. When asked about her, Trey Parker responded, \"Oh, she's alright. Sally Struthers isn't really a bad person, she's just a ripe person for jokes. Dude she sets herself up for it. It's like, 'Just do voiceovers', you know? Because she's fat. Because she's enormously fat and she's standing in front of a bunch of really skinny, starving people going, 'Look at these poor kids'. You're going, Dude, 'Give them some of your pie.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://treyparker.info/archives_juice_00oct98.htm|title=A Fireside Chat with Matt and Trey|date=October 1998}}</ref>\n*In the Latin American dub of \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" she was incorrectly referred to as Shelley Winters, a famous actress of the Hollywood Golden Era.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\"- Appears in commercials for adoption.
