Joline believes this makes her daughter \"a god damn whore\".\n\n==Appearance==\nJoline has messy blonde hair with brown highlights. She may be one of the more poor characters in the show, as she wears a pink shirt with stains and rips in it as well as blue pants and black shoes. She wears purple makeup on her eyelids and has small red earrings on both ears.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Joline\">\nFreakStrike137.png|Joline with the other mothers and out of control kids\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Freak Strike]]\"\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen on the Pro-War side of the protest.\n*\"[[Goobacks]]\" - Seen with the crowd of rednecks complaining about the people of the future taking their jobs.\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" - Seen as the crowd left the Park County Community center at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Follow That Egg!]]\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Six}}\n[[zh:乔丽娜]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mona Marshall]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
