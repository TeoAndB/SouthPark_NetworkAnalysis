He tells Satan that he must \"be wary\" because he invited so many celebrities that there aren't enough wristbands for people in Hell. He later suggests a donut machine after Satan is told that [[P. Diddy]] had taken his ideas for a dessert for the party. Later on at the party, he is seen dressed up as Captain America when one of the hotel staff members tells him that Satan's [[Ferrari Cake]] never showed up. He then decides to replace the Ferrari Cake with an Acura Cake, much to Satan's anger.\n\n==Appearance==\nDemonius has a head with a bald top and long gray hair on the sides and gray eyebrows. He has a large scratch on his left eye, making it look different from his other eye. He wears a large black robe that obscures his feet. He also has very sharp fingernails and pale wrinkly skin.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Demonius\">\nHell on Earth (4).png\nHell on Earth (29).png\nHell on Earth (57).png\nHell on Earth (87).png\nHell on Earth (106).png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:戴蒙纽斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Immortals]]\n[[Category:Demons]]"
