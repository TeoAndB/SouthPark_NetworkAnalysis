In the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump lost his bid for re-election.\n\n==Background==\nMr. Garrison, tired of the airline check-ins, designed a new way of transport, known as [[IT]]. He invites a group of rich and famous people to view IT. Trump is shown to be impressed with it.\n\n==Appearance==\nDonald Trump wears a black jacket and a white shirt. He is shown to have wrinkles.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There have been many parodies of Donald Trump in the series.\n**In \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\", a [[Canadian President|Canadian version]] of Donald Trump appeared.
