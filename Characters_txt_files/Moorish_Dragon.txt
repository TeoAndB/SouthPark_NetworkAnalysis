"{{South Park character\n|name = Moorish Dragon\n|image = TFBWDragon.png\n|race = Dragon\n|appearance = ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''\n}}\nThe '''Moorish Dragon''' is a made-up dragon controlled by the Moorish army. It is encountered during the combat tutorial in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the battle against the Moorish, [[The New Kid|King Douchebag]] brought down several warriors before approaching [[Cartman Residence|Cartman's house]], home to the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]]. In their final attempt to defeat the king, the Moorish released the dragon from [[Stotch Residence|Butters' house]], but was defeated by the King's ultimate power, which awarded them the \"Dragon Slayer\" title.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe dragon is green in color and entirely crafted with cardboard.

The dragon is maneuvered with a red wagon which must be controlled by external units.\n\n==Abilities==\n{{TFBW Enemy Abilities\n|Name = Moorish Dragon\n|Image = Tb dragon.png\n|Health = 400\n|Move = 0\n|Immunities = None\n|AbilityImage1 = Dragon power1.png\n|Ability1 = Deadly Arrow\n|Description1 = Garrisoned units on the dragon will shoot an arrow on the New Kid\n|RangeDesc1 = Where the New Kid is positioned.
