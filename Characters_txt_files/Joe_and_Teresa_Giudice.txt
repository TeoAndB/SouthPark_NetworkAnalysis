They are parodied in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, \"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\".\n\n==Background==\nJoe and Teresa Giudice move to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], Colorado where they become [[Stan Marsh]]'s new neighbors. The Marshes invite the new family to dinner, where Teresa displays her bad temper and attitude, gossiping about the people in South Park and insulting [[Sharon Marsh]]. Every time Teresa becomes angry, her husband Joe tries to calm her down.\n\nLater, while at the beauty salon with her friends Jacqueline, Danielle, and Caroline, Teresa becomes offended when asked to wait ten minutes for another client by the hairdresser. She acts belligerent and nasty towards the customers and staff until [[Sheila Broflovski]], who was once also from New Jersey, slaps Teresa and calls her a \"psycho-bitch\" and a \"trashy whore\". This causes Teresa back down and leave the Salon in shock and horror, along with the other housewives.\n\n==Appearance==\nTeresa has a dark complexion and wears heavy make-up. She is seen wearing a black and purple dress and gold bracelets. She has black hair with brown highlights.\n\nJoe wears black pants, a black shirt, and gold chains. He has short black hair and is shown to be physically strong.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Joe and Teresa Giudice\">\nItsAJerseyThing007.png|Teresa on New Jersey Housewives.\nJoeatmarshes.png|Joe seen at the Marshes' dinner.\nItsAJerseyThing012.png|Joe trying to calm Teresa down.\nItsAJerseyThing021.png|Teresa arguing with a customer at the beauty salon.\nItsAJerseyThing028.png|[[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] yelling at Teresa.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nTeresa is physically and verbally abusive to everyone, while Joe is more controlled, often shown trying to constrain Teresa. Teresa is also very ill-tempered, prone to angry and violent outbursts at even the slightest provocation. They are both incredibly narcissistic and materialistic as well, with their primary concern being their physical appearances.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n[[zh:特蕾莎·朱迪斯]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Criminal celebrities]]"
