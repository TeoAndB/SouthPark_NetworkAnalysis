Both the [[Coon and Friends]] and [[Freedom Pals]] attempt to recover the cat so that they could receive the reward to help support their movie franchise.\n\nScrambles is eventually found in [[Harrison Yates]]' office during [[The Thin White Line]] mission, where Yates was using it to cheese himself. When Scrambles is recovered, an argument is heated up over which faction should get the reward, starting off another fight between both factions.\n\n[[zh:小挠挠（完整破碎）]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Video Game Exclusive characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Cats]]"
