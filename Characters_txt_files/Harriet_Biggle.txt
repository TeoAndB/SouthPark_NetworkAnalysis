She made brief appearances in \"[[Raisins]]\" and \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\". On both occasions, she walks in on Henrietta in her room, for which she both praises Henrietta and is berated verbally. She was also a secondary antagonist in \"[[Turd Burglars]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Raisins]]\", Henrietta remarks that her mother often 'bitches' at her for not wearing 'girly clothes' like everyone else, but during the later poetry reading when her mother makes her appearance, Harriet sweetly teases Henrietta that they had purchased her a birthday gift and tells her she is creative. Henrietta accuses her mother of secretly wishing maggots would consume her.\n\nShe returns in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\" when she insists that Henrietta allow her brother [[Bradley Biggle]] to play with her friends when he asks to fingerpaint, revealing that they are siblings. Bradley recognizes that his sister is speaking with [[Mysterion]] and decides to change and resume his superhero role.\n\nIn \"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\", she sits with [[Mr. Biggle|her husband]] as they confront their daughter about her out-of-control behavior and decide to  send her off to camp. When Henrietta returns, she bakes cookies for her and her friends and expresses joy that she isn't being called a 'bitch' and received an apology. When her daughter returns to normal and calls her a 'conformist bag of demon jizz', she retorts 'fatty' and leaves.\n\nThe episode \"[[Dead Kids]]\" reveals her first name; she and [[Linda Stotch]] lead [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] to the [[South Park Elementary|Elementary]] entrance hall so that [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] could serenade his wife, much to her anger. Sharon berates Harriet and the others for not seeing the issue in constant school shootings.\n\nIn \"[[Turd Burglars]]\", she tries to bribe [[The Boys]] into getting [[Sheila Broflovski]]'s feces for a ''[[List of Video Game References|Jedi: Fallen Order]]'' game and accuses Sheila of tainting her feces because she thought she knew she would steal them. It also shows that Harriet can be quite self-centered and deceitful.\n\n==Personality and Traits==\nHarriet is usually optimistic, with a cheerful voice, even when Henrietta insults her and calls her names. In \"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\", when her husband told her to be 'firm and direct', she responded to her daughter with, 'How's my little sunshine?\" She appears to ignore Henrietta's insults but still loves her very much. She is always concerned about her daughter's behavior, and even sending her to an 'Emo Camp'. However, she doesn't really know how to properly respond firmly to Henrietta, and when she got dissed by her, she simply responded 'fatty.' She seems sensitive as she is rather hurt when Sharon insults her for not grasping the severity of school shootings, and exhibits deceit when she asks the boys to help her acquire Sheila's fecal matter, later accusing Sheila of manipulating her.\n\n==Appearance==\nHarriet wears a yellow button-up shirt under an orange sweater and a dark blue skirt. She also wears pink earrings and black shoes. She has wavy brown hair, brown eyebrows, and red lipstick.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Mrs. Biggle\" spacing=\"small\">\nMrsBiggle2.png|Mrs. Biggle in \"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\".\nsp_0714_08_v6.jpg|Mrs. Biggle with her daughter, Henrietta in \"[[Raisins]]\"\nTurd_burglars_21.png|Mrs. Biggle is angry at Sheila in [[Turd Burglars]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Family==\n===[[Henrietta Biggle]]===\nHenrietta is her biological daughter. She often appears to be in denial of Henrietta's rude attitude and her extreme dislike for her own mother. In spite of this, she loves her daughter very much and praises her creativity. She does seem to harbor some fear and resentment towards her however, backing away in \"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\".\n\n===[[Bradley Biggle]]===\nBradley is her adopted son. She appears to care for him very much as she suggests to Henrietta that she should allow Bradley to play with her much to Henrietta's dismay. However in \"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\", there is a notable lack of Bradley's presence in family pictures. She nonetheless identifies her as Bradley's mother to the boys in \"[[Turd Burglars]]\".\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" - briefly speaks to her daughter.\n*\"[[The Ungroundable]]\" (mentioned) - Henrietta mentions that she took her mother's car.\n*\"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\" - Asks her daughter to allow her son to play with her.\n*\"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\" - Sends her daughter to camp.\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\" - Informs [[Sharon]] about another school shooting. \n*\"[[Turd Burglars]]\" - Steals Sheila's feces and accuses her of tainting it.\n*\"[[The Pandemic Special]]\" - Appeared in a Zoom conference with [[Mr. Mackey]] and other parents.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nHarriet can be found sitting on a bench on Main Street with some groceries and her cell phone. She recognizes that [[The New Kid]] is the age of her son Bradley and adds him on Facebook, remarking that she thinks he is truly special. She can only be obtained on the first day of the game and will be absent afterwards whether the player adds her or not.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nHarriet can be found inside the [[Biggle Residence]], where she is pouring [[Mintberry Crunch]] cereal to eat. She and her family can also later be found eating at [[Casa Bonita (Location)|Casa Bonita]] in the [[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]] storyline.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n[[es:Sra.
