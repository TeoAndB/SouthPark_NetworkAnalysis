Jakartha completed this task, rather reluctantly at first, by shooting the egg with a sniper rifle. This egg was later revealed to be a fake, a dud, set up by Kyle because he did not believe that Stan would be able to care for it.\n\nHe later tried to assassinate the egg again, by shooting at it quite rapidly and setting up hidden bombs.
