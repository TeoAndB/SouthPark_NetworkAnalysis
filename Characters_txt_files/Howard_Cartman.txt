He then tries to get out the bathroom window but Charles tells him to go alone and that he will surrender to the police. Howard for some reason surrenders to the police with him, and before he is finally taken back to prison, apologizes to his parents (Cartman's grandparents) for what he has done.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Howard Cartman\">\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson25.png|Howard having dinner with his family via satellite.\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson35.png|Howard in \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\".\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson44.png|Cartman talking to Howard and Charlie.\nMerryChristmasCharlieManson93.png|Howard, after being rearrested.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe seems to be willing to break the law, breaking out of jail.
