They appear in \"[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe Thompsons met each other at a TPS convention in [[France]]. According to them, they still have fully functional facial organs, such as mouths, noses, and ears, and, contrary to what is said, do not have faces where their buttocks should be. They also claim that more than 11 people worldwide suffer from Torsonic Polarity Syndrome.\n\nThe Thompsons come to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] from Wisconsin after seeing the photo of Kenny on the milk carton, believing it was their son, Tommy. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson become a minor attraction in South Park for their unusual appearance. Whenever the abnormality is brought up in discussion by the couple in conversation, the others pretend not to notice out of kindness or to prevent embarrassment. Their son is revealed to be [[Ben Affleck]], who had apparently been missing for over 20 years. \n\nIn \"[[Freak Strike]],\" the Thompsons can be seen in the picket line with the [[True Freaks Union|other individuals with deformities]] and in the background of their [[True Freaks Union (Song)|protest video]]. In \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]],\" they make cameos, along with many other minor or one-off characters from previous episodes, during the [[Bleeding Heart Rock Protest Song vs. Pro War Country Song|ending song]].\n\n==Appearance==\nThey both have buttocks for faces. Martha has blonde hair and she wears a pink shirt and blue pants. Stephen is bald and wears a blue shirt with a red tie and gray pants. Both wear black shoes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"Images of Martha and Stephen\" widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nHowtoEatwithYourButt053.png|Martha and Stephen researching their son in the database in \"[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]\"\nHowtoEatwithYourButt028.png|Martha and Stephen learning of [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s prank\nHowtoEatwithYourButt050.png|Martha and Stephen touring the milk company\nHowtoEatwithYourButt033.png|Martha and Stephen visiting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to follow up on the ad on the milk carton\nHowtoEatwithYourButt047.png|Martha and Stephen sitting with the McCormicks, explaining their situation.\nFreakStrike144.png|Martha and Stephen in the True Freaks Union crowd\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]\" - They come to South Park after they saw a picture of Kenny's butt on a milk carton, which they believe is their own son who went missing several years prior.\n*\"[[Freak Strike]]\" - Seen in the True Freaks Union crowd.\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" - Appear in the crowd with townspeople.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen in the crowd.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen running after the boys for the vaccine and later seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[es:Martha y Stephen Thompson]]\n[[ja:スティーヴン＆マーサ・トンプソン]]\n[[zh:史蒂芬和玛莎·汤普森]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
