He appears in an identical role in the episode \"[[Pip]]\".\n\nJoe Gargery is [[Pip Pirrip|Pip]]'s brother-in-law. He is a blacksmith and is also the husband of Pip's hot-tempered [[Mrs. Joe Gargery|adult sister]].\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has an elongated face, a red nose, and really bad teeth. He has brown hair, badly-kept stubble, and hairy arms. He appears dressed in dark red overalls and brown shirt.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Joe Gargery\">\nPip013.png|Joe Gargery with a metal newspaper.\nPip030.png|Joe training [[Pip Pirrip]] to be a blacksmith.\n</gallery>\n\n==Family==\n===[[Pip Pirrip]]===\nJoe has taken Pip on as his apprentice and wishes to teach him in the trade of being a blacksmith. When the lawyer from London comes to take Pip to be a gentleman, he appears to be disappointed that Pip is leaving him to be a gentleman rather than a blacksmith, but appears genuinely happy for Pip, remarking that Pip is \"A young gentleman of great expectations!\"\n===[[Mrs. Joe Gargery]]===\nHis short-tempered wife, Pip's grown sister, is dismissive towards him and his work, often being obnoxious and abusive towards him as well as disparagingly calling him things like \"metal-pounding fairy\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*One of the things Gargery creates is a metal orange. This is likely a reference to the novella ''A Clockwork Orange'' by Anthony Burgess, which was adapted into a film starring [[Malcolm McDowell]], who appeared as the narrator of the episode.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[es:Joe Gargery]]\n[[zh:乔·盖格瑞]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Kyle McCulloch]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]"
