He is shown crapping his pants during a game and then taking his \"Bradying\" pose.\n\nHe was mentioned again in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\", where [[Eric Cartman]] says he is going to \"Tom Brady this thing\" after getting 4 days of detention from [[PC Principal]], referencing Brady's four-game suspension from the NFL due to the \"Deflategate\" scandal. Cartman later portrays Brady in a dream.\n\nBrady plays a significant role in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode \"[[Turd Burglars]]\", where several people, including the press, try to get their hands on his \"spice\" to cure the C Diff disease by asking him if they can have some of his feces.\n\nIn the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\", one of the notes on [[Bob White]]'s conspiracy theory board reads \"THE SUPER BOWL WAS FAKED FORMER 'PATRIOT' WINS?\". This is in reference to Brady, who had left the New England Patriots to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020. It is also a reference to several conspiracy theories on the internet that claim Super Bowl LV was fixed in Brady's favor. \n\n== Appearance ==\nTom Brady has brown hair and brown eyebrows. He wears a blue New England Patriots uniform with his team number \"12\" on it as well as white pants and white sneakers. In \"[[Turd Burglars]]\", he also wears a gray hooded sweatshirt and black pants. He has slight facial stubble.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Faith Hilling]]\"\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\"\n*\"[[Taming Strange]]\"\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\"\n*\"[[Turd Burglars]]\"\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Tom Brady\">\nBradying.png|A real life image of Tom Brady is shown \"Bradying\" on the news in \"[[Faith Hilling]]\".\nSarcastaball19.png|Tom drinking [[Butters' Creamy Goo]] in \"[[Sarcastaball]]\".\nTamingStrange00045.png|Tom Brady doing his signature pose after crapping his pants in \"[[Taming Strange]]\".\nTurd_burglars_16.png| Tom speaking for the press in \"[[Turd Burglars]]\".\nSPVS113.png| One of the notes referencing Brady's move from the Patriots to the Buccaneers and winning Super Bowl LV in \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-Three}}\n{{SportsCelebrities}}\n[[ja:トム・ブレイディ]]\n[[zh:汤姆·布雷迪]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Sports celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
