He wears a white shirt under a black jacket, dark blue pants and black shoes.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Scott-Clubhouses.png|thumb|left|Scott in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\".]]\nIn \"[[Clubhouses]]\", when teenage girls are talking to Cartman inside a treehouse, Scott and [[Jonesy|another boy]] show up and the girls welcome them. Cartman immediately asks who they are and the girls respond that they invited some people to their clubhouse. Scott is then later seen along with the other teenage guests making noise in the clubhouse, he also appears among the people who accidentally kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in a mosh pit in the clubhouse.\n\nScott made a notable appearance in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", but without a speaking role.\n\nScott's last notable appearance was in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\", where he joins the [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] to try to retrieve a porn tape [[the boys]] were carrying.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Jonesy]]===\nJonesy is a member of [[The Lords of the Underworld]]. Scott is seen arriving at the clubhouse with him in \"[[Clubhouses]]\". However, as the band did not exist at that time and Jonesy's character was only officially introduced in \"[[Cat Orgy]]\", it is possible that in this episode he was acting as someone else. Scott is seen watching Jonesy's band on \"[[Timmy 2000]]\".\n\n===[[Runaway Girls]]===\nScott and Jonesy are apparently invited by the two girls. Scott is seen with one of them in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\", so we can assume that they are great friends.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Gets invited to Cartman's clubhouse by two runaway girls.\n*\"[[Chef Aid]]\" - Seen in the crowd at the concert.\n*\"[[Timmy 2000]]\" - Seen watching [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] and [[The Lords of the Underworld]].\n*\"[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]\" - Seen in the crowd.\n*\"[[It Hits the Fan]]\"\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" -  Seen watching [[Scott Tenorman]]'s video of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] pretending to be a pig.
