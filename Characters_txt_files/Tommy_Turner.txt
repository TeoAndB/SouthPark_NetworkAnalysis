He first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhile in shop class, he comically belt-sanded his face leaving it blank. He was then sent to the nurse's office by [[Richard Adler|Mr. Adler]]. His face was later restored in subsequent episodes.\n\nIn \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\", he and [[Sally Turner]] appear to be siblings in the same household during the [[Mr. Hankey]] song sequence.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has curly brown hair and wears an orange shirt with a zipper on it, brown shoes, and dark blue trousers. At first, he appeared with absolutely nothing where his face would have been. Since watching [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] fight, his face is shown normally.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Tommy Turner\">\nTommy turner.jpg|Tommy cheering at the fight.\nTommy.jpeg|Tommy after having his face removed by a sander.\nTommy.jpg|Another picture of Tommy.\nTommySally.png|With Sally Turner in \"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Tommy shares his last name with a third-grader, [[Billy Turner]], and two other 4th Graders, [[Heidi Turner]] and [[Sally Turner]].\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" - Lost his face due to an accident with a sander; he was presumably treated as he was later seen with a face.\n*\"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\" - Seen watching the costume contest.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\" - Seen with Sally Turner.\n*\"[[Timmy 2000]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\" - Seen at [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s party.\n*\"[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]\"\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Seen in the background in the [[South Park Elementary Cafeteria|cafeteria]].\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" - Seen at [[Raisins (Location)|Raisins]].\n*\"[[AWESOM-O]]\" - Seen when Butters shows the video of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] to everyone.
