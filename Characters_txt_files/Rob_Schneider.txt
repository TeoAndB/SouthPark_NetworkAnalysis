He appears in the [[Season Six]] episode, \"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\". \n\n==Background==\nHe finds and eats the pot-roast which contains Kenny's soul when [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Liane Cartman|his mom]] accidentally leave it at the airport in Denver. In a spoof of the plot of many of his films, he is transformed into [[Kenny McCormick]] and eventually dies as Kenny, getting shot in the head and impaled on a flagpole, mirroring Kenny's death in \"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\". The resulting movie was entitled ''Kenny''.\n\nRob was other different things before he was Kenny, starring in such movies as ''The Animal'', ''The Hot Chick'', ''The Stapler'', ''A Carrot'' and ''Da Derp De Derp Da Teetley Derpee Derpee Dumb'' - all of which are rated PG-13.\n\nHe is later revived somehow and seen among the celebrities threatening to sue South Park in the promotional image for the episode \"[[200]]\". He does not actually appear in the episode but he does appear in his carrot form in \"[[201]]\". \n\nHe reappears in \"[[Funnybot]]\" in a silent role as one of the comedians attacking [[South Park Elementary]]. Unlike other celebrity characters from the earlier half of the series, his design has not been tweaked.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nOver at the [[Bijou Cinema|cinema]], several movie trailers for Rob Schneider's movies including some listed above can be heard in the movie theater.\n\n==Appearance==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Rob Schneider\">\nTheBiggestDoucheintheUniverse022.png|Rob Schneider as a stapler.\nTheBiggestDoucheintheUniverse065.png|Rob Schneider as a carrot.\nTheBiggestDoucheintheUniverse107.png|Rob Schneider's reaction after he drank the strange liquid in a bottle.\nTheBiggestDoucheintheUniverse144.png|Rob Schneider counting his money in a movie role.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Six}}\n[[es:Rob Schneider]]\n[[zh:罗伯·施奈德]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
