He is a parody of Zac Efron's character Troy Bolton from ''High School Musical''. \n\n==Background==\nBridon attends [[South Park Elementary]]. He gains great popularity due to his singing and dancing abilities. In fact, it is stated by [[Bebe Stevens]] that Bridon has seen \"High School Musical 3\" over 100 times, which apparently makes him a huge favorite among the girls, who all have a crush on him. The boys seem to like him equally as much, due to the fact that he is such a great singer. However, although he has great theatrical abilities, what he really wants is to play basketball as he later confesses to [[Stan Marsh]], who dislikes the musical craze and the attention that his girlfriend [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] shows Bridon.\n\nDespite being popular and talented, his family life is obviously abusive. He has a crazed, effeminate, theater-obsessed [[Mr. Gueermo|father]] who forces him to sing and dance every moment of the day, even during normal conversations, and is appalled by the thought of him playing basketball. Whenever Bridon attempts to talk to his dad about quitting musical theater, his father would threaten to slap him (in a whiny and effeminate manner). His [[Mrs. Gueermo|mother]] meanwhile does what she can to protect Bridon, but usually bears the brunt of her husband's anger.\n\nAfter Mr. Gueermo assaults not only the [[Mr. Garrett|basketball coach]] but also [[Mr. Mackey]] and two agents from Child Protective Services, and also with Stan's encouragement, Bridon finally plucks up the courage to attempt to run away from [[Gueermo Residence|home]]. However, his father attempts to stop him and proceeds to once again threaten Bridon with a slapping. Fed up with his father, Bridon stands up to him by punching him in the nose. Never having suffered such violence before, Mr. Gueermo is confused and horrified as he clutches his bleeding nose, and rushes to his wife's side. She, however, having never considered striking back against her husband, finally stands up for herself as well by punching Mr. Gueermo several additional times.\n\nBridon then joins the basketball team, where he proves to be one of the star players. His parents apparently remain together despite the domestic violence, although his father is initially unhappy about being there. However, Mr. Gueermo soon discovers that he enjoys [[We Will Rock You|the cheering aspect]] of sports, possibly resulting in the reconciliation for the family. In \"[[201]]\", the Gueermo family is seen huddled together, clutching one another on the roof of the [[Park County Community Center]] during [[Barbra Streisand|Mecha-Streisand]]'s rampage.\n\n==Appearance==\nBridon has shaggy dark brown hair, and is seen wearing a blue shirt with blue jeans. He also wears a red bracelet and has black shoes.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Bridon Gueermo\">\n145a.jpg|Bridon on [[South Park Studios]].\nBridon1.png|Bridon playing basketball in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\".\nBridon butterballs.png|Bridon in \"[[Butterballs]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nBridon seems perpetually depressed due to his father's abuse. However, after he stands up for himself and joins the basketball team, his depressed state disappears and he appears to be happy.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" - His first appearance. Bridon is a singer who is forced by his father to sing and dance, but really just wants to be on the basketball team.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Appears with his parents on the roof of the community center, hiding from Mecha-Streisand. \n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Appears in [[Make Bullying Kill Itself|Stan's anti-bullying video]]. \n\n==Trivia==\n*Though he is portrayed to be like Zac Efron's character \"Troy Bolton\" in the ''High School Musical'' trilogy, Bridon's story is a complete reversal of Troy's. In HSM, Troy wanted to sing and dance while his father and friends wanted him to play basketball because that's what he does. Bridon however wants to play basketball but his father (primarily) and friends want him to keep dancing and singing.\n*Despite the fact that Wendy and the other girls all have crushes on Bridon and give him great amounts of attention, he does not seem particularly interested in them and is even unhappy about having to work with Wendy during the musical as opposing leads. This could mean he either has no sexual interest, or he is secretly gay.\n*Bridon's family name \"Gueermo\" sounds suspiciously like \"Queer-mo\", possibly due to his father's flamboyant and feminine behavior.\n*Despite the fact Bridon is in the 3rd grade, he still manages to burst into the 4th grade classroom, during class time to join in Wendy's musical number.\n*Bridon is one of the 2 boys in the series that all the girls in the series are in love with, the other being [[The New Kid]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n\n<!--Interwiki links-->\n[[es:Bridon Gueermo]]\n[[fr:Bridon Gueermo]]\n[[ru:Брайдон Гуермо]]\n[[zh:布莱登·谷尔莫]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:3rd graders]]"
