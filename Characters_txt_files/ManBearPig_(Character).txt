Initially, he is described by [[Al Gore]] as being a half man, half bear and half pig and was thought by many to be fake, but was proven to be real later on in \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\".\n\nHe is also one of the evil characters in [[Imaginationland (Location)|Imaginationland]], due to Al Gore's imagining him being there.\n\nHe is the main antagonist of the \"[[Time To Get Cereal|Cereal]]\" story arc. \n\n==Background==\nManBearPig's first \"appearance\" was in the episode of the [[ManBearPig|same name]]. [[Al Gore]] gives a presentation to the students of [[South Park Elementary]], in which he claims that the creature walks the Earth alone and \"doesn't care who you are or what you did, he simply wants to get you\". Al Gore also says that he is the one to kill ManBearPig and that he is \"super cereal\". [[The boys]] do not believe him.\n\nLater, when they are playing basketball, the silhouette of a mysterious creature is seen across the horizon. It is immediately revealed to be Al Gore in disguise attempting to spread awareness of ManBearPig. [[Randy Marsh|Randy]] later picks the boys up, telling them there is no such thing as a ManBearPig and that Al Gore is just trying to look for attention.\n\nThe next day [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], feeling sorry for Al Gore, convinces [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to go hunting with him for ManBearPig in the cave of winds. Al Gore leads them away from the tour to find \"clues\" to ManBearPig. Al Gore gives the boys really weird jobs, such as looking for ManBearPig's droppings. Unfortunately, Al Gore accidentally causes a cave in, but he falsely believes it to be ManBearPig, and flees the cave with the tour.\n\nThe boys however end up being trapped in the cave. While everybody is trying to dig out the boys, Al Gore attempts to flood the cave. The diggers free the boys, just as the flood destroys the cave. Al Gore ecstatically believes he has killed ManBearPig, but is shouted at angrily by Stan for nearly killing him and his friends. However, Al Gore doesn't seem to care in the least, and goes off to make a movie about himself.\n[[File:ImaginationlandPartII17.jpg|200px|thumb|ManBearPig kills [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in \"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\".]]\nManBearPig returns in the Imaginationland trilogy. It is revealed he has a speaking voice when he denies the Minotaur as the most evil Imaginary character. He returns later when the portal between Imaginationland opens, and he rampages in a government laboratory. ManBearPig kills various people, including Kyle. Fortunately, however, Cartman successfully revives Kyle, but only to later force him to suck his balls. ManBearPig is sucked back into Imaginationland, and Stan is pulled in with him.\n\nAl Gore pores over security footage and uncovers evidence of ManBearPig's existence. Upon learning this, he declares that the imagination must be nuked. The government agrees, but only because Imaginationland has a terrorist connection.\n\nManBearPig is later seen in the battle for Imaginationland in the climax of the trilogy. However, his ultimate fate remains unknown. He is most likely back behind the wall with the other evil Imaginary characters.\n\nManBearPig returns in \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\", and goes on a rampage in South Park and the surrounding area. He is first seen abducting Ned at Tegridy Farms, severely injuring him. Later, he brutally mauls two children outside South Park Elementary, though [[Harrison Yates|Officer Yates]] assumes the cause of death is another school shooting. ManBearPig is next seen slaughtering most, if not all, the customers at Red Lobster before attacking a Baskin-Robbins, as well. With help from Al Gore and Satan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Stan discover that ManBearPig is a demon who was summoned to Earth decades ago. The boys are subsequently arrested for the \"shootings\" as [[Marvin Marsh]] watches the news in shock, suggesting he is the summoner.\n\n[[File:ManBearPig vs Satan.png|230px|thumb|ManBearPig fighting and killing [[Satan]] in \"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\".]]\nManBearPig's rampage continues in \"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\", starting with the murder of a couple outside a Jared. The boys manage to escape from jail and split up. Once back at Tegridy Farms, Stan learns that his grandfather was responsible for summoning ManBearPig and goes to confront him about it. Marvin admits summoning the demon decades ago, but didn't realize he would live to see the consequences of his actions. In the meantime, Kenny, Cartman and Kyle request help from [[Satan]] who agrees to help the boys defeat ManBearPig. However, in the fight with Satan, ManBearPig manages to subdue and kill him by ripping off his left horn and plunging it into his chest.\n\nStan, who was granted power of attorney by his town, enters in a sit-down negotiations with ManBearPig which tells them that he will never come back again if they will give up soy sauce and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', but people outside the court show reluctance and refuse to sign the agreement. Stan has no choice but to talk with ManBearPig's lawyer about restructuring another deal in which ManBearPig is set to return in five years, in which time the carnage will be a thousand-fold.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn the drawing presented by Al Gore, ManBearPig is shown to be a humanoid creature with hooves, claws, fur growing all over his body, pig-like ears and snout.\n\nHis appearance in Imaginationland was often different. He was portrayed as a hulking chimera whose face is that of a pig on one side and that of a bear on the other. His body is partly covered in hair and has some human features on his torso. He has human-like legs and pig-like feet. The left side of his face is fully covered in blood.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of ManBearPig\">\nGhjkl.JPG|Al Gore gives a presentation about ManBearPig.\nManbearpig03.jpg|[[Al Gore]] dressed up as ManBearPig in \"[[ManBearPig]]\"\nSPMBP5.jpg|Al Gore talks to the boys about the dangerous creature.\nSPMBP6.jpg|Poor Al Gore doesn't have any friends.\nSPMBP7.jpg|Al Gore holds up a picture of ManBearPig.\nSPMBP2.jpg|ManBearPig kills [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in \"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\".\nSPMBP4.jpg|Al Gore points out ManBearPig in some security footage.\nSPMBP1.jpg|ManBearPig goes after Kyle.\nmanbearpig 1.png\nmanbearpig 3.png\nmanbearpig 4.png\nmanbearpig 6.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nManBearPig is at least physically stronger than Satan. However, it is unknown if is ManBearPig truly more powerful than Satan, since he did not possessed a human host like [[Possessed Stan Marsh|Stan Marsh]] to use powers such as absorbing Vortex Creation or fire manipulation. His powers include, but are not limited to:\n*'''Super Strength:''' When ManBearPig appears in \"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\", he dismembered several scientists and nearly kills Kyle just because he could hold him hard. ManBearPig is also able to overcome Satan's strength in \"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\", killing the latter.\n*'''Injury Immunity:''' ManBearPig was shown to be immune to common weaponry in \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\", when [[Jimbo Kern]] tries to shoot the demon was immune to natural common weaponry.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite at first appearing to be a savage and mindless creature, ManBearPig is somewhat sentient as he is able to put on a suit and discuss the terms to stop his rampage at the end of \"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\" and celebrates the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in a club at the end of \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\"\n*ManBearPig works as a metaphor of [[wikipedia:Global Warming|Global Warming]], which can be confirmed by [[Al Gore]]'s lines before his bossfight in [[South Park: The Stick of Truth]].\n*In \"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\", it is revealed that ManBearPig is a demon summoned from Hell and his origin was originally unknown. Although implied to be a figment of Al Gore's imagination, a [[South Park Studios]] FAQ posting implied it might have been an experiment of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/2009/apr|title=South Park Studios FAQ|date=April 3, 2009}}</ref> This was of debatable validity, given that ManBearPig does not display any characteristics of Mephesto's other experiments.\n*ManBearPig's roars are stock sound effects lifted from the 1988 animated film'' The Land Before Time, '' used for the film's main antagonist, Sharptooth. Aforementioned roars were provided by legendary voice actor, Frank Welker.\n*ManBearPig's appearance since his physical debut in \"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\" is a homage to Katahdin, the mutated bear-monster from the 1979 horror film, ''Prophecy.''\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[ManBearPig]]\" - The creature does not actually appear in the episode named after it, for it exists only in [[Al Gore]]'s imagination.\n*\"[[Imaginationland, Episode II]]\" - Comes through the [[Project Imagination Doorway|Imagination Doorway]] and almost kills [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]].\n*\"[[Imaginationland, Episode III]]\" - Seen in the final battle.\n*\"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\" - Rampages through South Park killing people.\n*\"[[Nobody Got Cereal?]]\" - Continues his rampage, fights [[Satan]] in a battle to the death and wins, and he finally agrees to temporarily stop his rampage after hiring a lawyer to restructure a new deal with Stan.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n===Video Games===\n====''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]''====\nManBearPig is the penultimate boss in ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', on the level \"Mountain Pass\". Like other bosses, the players' goal is to keep him from reaching the town, or else the game is lost. His role in the overarching storyline is never explained. If players manage to kill ManBearPig without using any towers on Insane mode, they will earn a Platinum medal and the \"MANBEARPIG\" achievement.\n\n====''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]''====\nManBearPig appears as an enemy in ''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n[[es:HombreOsoCerdo]]\n[[it:Uomorsomaiale (Personaggio)]]\n[[ja:マンベアピッグ]]\n[[zh:人熊猪（角色）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Imaginationland characters]]\n[[Category:South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!
