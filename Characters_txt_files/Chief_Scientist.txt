"{{South Park character\n|name = Chief Scientist\n|image = Character-debuts-doctors-chief-scientist-cc.png\n|gender = Male \n|race = Caucasian\n|hair= Dark Brown\n|job = Pandemic Scientist\n|appearance = \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\"\n|final = \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\"\n|died = \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Chief Scientist''' was the scientist in charge of investigating [[COVID-19]] in the [[Season Twenty-Four]] episode, \"[[The Pandemic Special]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe Chief Scientist is interviewed on a news report where he announces that he and his team have pinpointed the virus to a certain [[bat]] in [[Wuhan]], [[China]]. What they do not understand is how the virus could have been transmitted from a bat to a human. Later, he finds that the animal that started the coronavirus is not a bat but a [[Pangolin]] which has been tracked down and brought to his research facility, the [[South Park Viral Research Center]].\n\n[[Randy Marsh]] is in a panic upon hearing this news. During his time in China in [[Band in China|the previous season]], he had sex with a pangolin under [[Mickey Mouse]]'s influence. He fell very sick following the incident but thought he was just having the flu. This means he is responsible for the transmission of the coronavirus from animals to humans, and he is afraid of being found out. Randy sneaks onto a tour of the research center for [[Pandemic Specialists]], during which the chief scientist says that another species inserted its DNA up the pangolin, and they need to obtain that DNA in order to develop a vaccine. Unknown to them, that is Randy's DNA. When the group moves on to the next location, Randy kidnaps the pangolin.\n\nThe pangolin is reported missing on the news and the scientists say they do not have what it takes to develop a vaccine. Randy receives a human heart in the mail from Mickey Mouse who says he will have him killed and his DNA sent to the scientists, but Randy convinces him that he will find an alternative solution.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Randy has a change of heart seeing the destruction of COVID-19 and decides to surrender the pangolin. He returns the pangolin to the chief scientist outside the [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] just before the police shoot at it. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], however, does not want a vaccine to end COVID-19 as he does not want to return to school. He nearly destroys the pangolin in the store's Do-over A Bear machine but [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] makes a passionate speech that makes him change his mind. He returns the pangolin to the chief scientist, who gives a speech about hope and working together. Just then, [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] shows up and burns the chief scientist and pangolin to death with a flamethrower, as he wants the pandemic to continue to help him get rid of all the Mexicans.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe chief scientist has dark brown hair, thick eyebrows, and wears glasses. He wears a white lab coat over a light blue shirt with a dark blue tie, gray pants, and black shoes.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-Four}}\n[[fr:Chief Scientist]]\n[[ja:首席科学顧問（\"The Pandemic Special\"）]]\n[[zh:首席科学家]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]"
