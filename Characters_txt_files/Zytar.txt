He appears in [[Season Five]] episode \"[[Towelie]]\".\n\n==Background==\nSome aliens target Earth as their new habitat because their home planet is dying. Before the hostile takeover, a vanguard, led by Zytar, is sent to Earth. Pretending to be a high-tech corporation called [[Tynacorp]] that manufactures smart towels, they actually spy on humans in order to see how human beings live. Their activities remain undercover, despite being suspected by a resistance group.\n\nZytar decides to get rid of the resistance group as he comes up with a very deliberate plan. He takes away the boys' [[2001 Okama Gamesphere|Okama Gamesphere]] and leads them to Tynacorp, bringing Towelie back at the same time. Then he takes advantage of the boys by lying to them that the resistance group is the bad guys. After that, he sends Towelie and the boys to their base. He ultimately plans to activate Towelie's self-destruction sequence after the boys sneak into the base, but fails.\n\nAs his plan goes unfold, he has no choice but to release [[GS-401]]. The resistance group breaks into Tynacorp and starts a fierce fight, during which an encryption disk is inserted to his computer causing the whole building to blow up, killing Zytar.\n\n==Appearance==\n===Human (Disguise)===\nZytar masks himself in disguise form. He looks like an old scientific researcher at [[Tynacorp]], wearing a white gown with blue suits underneath. He has white hair, gentle wrinkles, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He rides a scooter instead of walking. His fake identity is '''Gary''', shown on his work card.\n\n===Alien (Prototype)===\nWhen unmasked Zytar can be easily identified as an alien. He has chin barbels and gills, similar to a catfish. He also has six eyes, four dermal plates on his neck, and human-like teeth. His skin color is lime green. In alien form, he speaks in a digitally altered voice. His body remains the same and he still rides his scooter.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Five}}\n[[es:Zytar]]\n[[zh:泽塔]]\n[[Category:Aliens]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
