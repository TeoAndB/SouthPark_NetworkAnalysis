After a few men were brought down by [[The New Kid|King Douchebag]], the Moors summoned a [[Moorish Dragon|dragon]], but that was too defeated with the King's ultimate ability. As the King approaches the [[Kingdom of Kupa Keep]], a small group of fighters, led by [[Kevin Stoley]], were interrogating [[The Bard (Character)|The Bard]] on the whereabouts of the Stick of Truth. This was interrupted by [[Eric Cartman]], who decided to play superheroes instead (appearing as [[The Coon (Character)|The Coon]]), and instructs the Fighters of Zaron to follow suit. The Moorish fighters who do not have a superhero persona, to begin with, were left out, but not before being called \"dorks\".\n\n==Appearance==\nAll Moorish fighters are distinguished by their bicycle helmets, some with spikes attached. A standard warrior holds a small sword and a wooden shield. A bruiser dons a mask with a sharp teeth design and wields a battle-ax that is crafted from a road sign.\n\n==Abilities==\n{{TFBW Enemy Abilities\n|Name = Moorish Fighters\n|Image = Tb helmetkidswarmer b.png\n|Image2 = Tb helmetkidchamp b.png\n|Health = 40 (warrior)/70 (bruiser)\n|Move = 1\n|Immunities = None\n|AbilityImage1 = Kidswarmer melee.png\n|Ability1 = Puny Blows\n|Description1 = A Moorish warrior executes a simple attack with his sword.\n|RangeDesc1 = Enemy will stand next to the New Kid and attack\n|Range1 = Melee.png\n|Effect1 = 8 Damage\n|Status1 = None\n|AbilityImage2 = Kidbruiser melee.png\n|Ability2 = Great Axe\n|Description2 = A Moorish bruiser pummels the New Kid with his battle-ax.\n|RangeDesc2 = Enemy will stand next to the New Kid and attack\n|Range2 = Melee.png\n|Effect2 = 8 Damage\n|Status2 = None\n}}\n\n[[zh:摩尔人]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Fractured But Whole: Enemies]]"
