He looks down upon other adults because he believes they are not well educated compared to himself. He is extremely overprotective of his children. He home-schooled them (until they went to attend [[South Park Elementary]]) as well as sheltered them from anything sexual or social. The fact is, Mr. Cotswolds himself is home-schooled.\n\nHowever, at the end of \"[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]\", he realized his over-protectiveness was doing more harm than good, and allowed his children to attend public school.\n\n==Family==\n===[[Mrs. Cotswolds]]===\nHe is Mrs. Cotswold's husband. They both share similar personality traits, and as such, they tend to get along without issue.\n\n===[[Mark Cotswolds|Mark]] and [[Rebecca Cotswolds]]===\nHe treated both of his children similarly, protecting them beyond normal boundaries and shielding them from anything social or sexual. He presumably later started treating them normally, as [[Mark Cotswolds|Mark]] made him realize his parenting style was doing more harm than good.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[es:Sr. Cotswolds]]\n[[zh:科茨沃尔兹先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters in a relationship]]\n[[Category:Parents]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
