"{{South Park character\n|name = Storehand\n|image = storehand.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Gray\n|job = [[Pioneer Village]] Character Actor\n|voice = [[Matt Stone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220462/|title=\"Super Fun Time\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Super Fun Time]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Storehand''' is the owner of [[Pioneer Village]]'s general store, played by an unnamed employee, who appears in the [[Season Twelve]] episode, \"[[Super Fun Time]]\". \n\n==Background==\nWhen Franz and his gang arrived and began rounding up hostages, the Storehand escaped initially along with [[Pioneer Paul]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Wendy Testaburger]], and [[Jimmy Valmer]], and hid in the administration office.\n\nWhen Kyle asked how to dial out on the phone, both Paul and the Storehand pretended not to know what he was talking about, although the Storehand insisted to \"Brian\", Pioneer Paul, that the presence of the robbers was justification to break character. Paul simply pointed out a plaque reminding employees never to break character, and thereafter the Storehand stayed in character all the time, even after he and Paul were captured by the criminals. Later he and the other employees were saved when the police stormed Pioneer Village and killed most of the criminals. He broke character when Pioneer Village closed and told Kyle everything he needed to know.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Storehand wears brown pants, a long sleeved white shirt, a dark brown vest, and a black bow tie. He has gray hair on the sides of his head with some of it combed over. He wears round framed glasses and has a pocket watch in his left vest pocket. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n[[zh:掌柜]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
