"{{South Park character\n|name = Frosty\n|image = Pilot-characters-frosty.png\n|gender = Male\n|race = Snowman\n|appearance = ''[[The Spirit of Christmas#Jesus vs. Frosty|Jesus vs. Frosty]]''\n}}\n'''Frosty''' appeared in student short film ''Jesus vs. Frosty''. A prototype of [[the boys]] accidentally brought a snowman to life with a magic hat, parodying the Rankin/Bass special ''Frosty the Snowman''. Instead of being kind, the snowman is evil and murders [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], the only character with a name.\n\nThe film features four kids who are very similar of the four main characters of ''[[South Park]]'', including a character resembling Cartman, but called \"Kenny\", and three nameless boys resembling [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]].\n\n==Appearance==\nFrosty had red eyes and a wide mouth with sharp teeth. He wore a top hat and was made out of snow. He also had blue tentacles.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Frosty has had the longest absence among all characters from the show.\n*Frosty is the only character that appeared in a pre-South Park short but not in the main series.\n\n[[cs:Frosty]]\n[[es:Frosty]]\n[[uk:Фрості]]\n[[zh:霜白]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Christmas]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
