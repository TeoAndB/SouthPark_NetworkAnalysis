Although both he and [[Leonard Maltin]] fail in their efforts, [[Robert Smith]] manages to destroy Streisand in the end.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\", Poitier transforms into a [[w:c:godzilla:Gamera|Gamera]]-like monster in order to fight Mecha-Streisand. He is tossed into a mountain by her and has yet to make another appearance. Although he helps defeat Mecha Streisand, Poitier did in fact seem pretty villainous when he heard that she had the diamond, he probably planning on using it for his own purposes.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Poitier2.JPG|left|thumb|Poitier after transforming.]]\nBefore he transformed, Sidney wore green pants, a white shirt with a black tie, and a brown coat. He has black hair but has graying sideburns. \n\nAfter he transformed, he appears similar to Gamera, a creature from the Gamera series. His transformation looks like a giant tortoise with large muscles with a human head.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[es:Sidney Poitier]]\n[[zh:西德尼·波蒂埃]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]"
