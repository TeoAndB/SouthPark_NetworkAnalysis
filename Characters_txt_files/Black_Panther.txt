He was first referenced in the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode, \"[[Dead Kids]]\", but first physically appears in the [[Season Twenty-Three]] episode, \"[[Band in China]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Dead Kids]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] explains to [[Token Black|Token]] about some rumors about him saying that the movie, ''Black Panther'' was a terrible movie. He claims that ''Black Panther'' was a great movie and that he is not a racist. Token admits that he never actually saw ''Black Panther''. Cartman is surprised at this and, later on, he talks to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] that he suspects Token for 'manipulating' his test grades. He reveals to him that he actually does not like ''Black Panther'' and thinks that Token had everyone fooled that he did not watch ''Black Panther''.\n\nCartman asks [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]] if Token brought her to see Black ''Panther ''and she replies that she knows nothing of it. Cartman refuses to accept the fact that she genuinely did not watch ''Black Panther'' with Token and keeps on interrogating her. Cartman arrives at the [[Black Residence|Black residence]] and asks [[Linda Black|Linda]] and [[Steve Black]] if Token watched ''Black Panther'' with them. Steve replies that he and Linda watched it on the night of their date. They are going to let Token watch it soon. They cannot allow Token to watch it alone as it is PG-13. Token kicks him out of the house. The next day, Cartman confronts Token in the boys' bathroom and admits he did not like Black Panther and Token tells Cartman he really did not see ''Black Panther''. Cartman threatens to tell his parents that he went to the theater to watch it without permission. Token reveals he does not actually care about Cartman's criticism about the movie. Cartman is unconvinced and feels Token also dislikes the movie. He tells Token he does not mind him disliking the movie, but just that he should not 'manipulate' and make Cartman fail his test again.\n\nBlack Panther is seen in \"[[Band in China]]\" as one of the Marvel characters aboard the flight to [[China]] along with [[Randy Marsh]].\n\nLater on, Black Panther was one of the Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars characters getting scolded by [[Mickey Mouse]] for criticizing the Chinese Government and being critical of Chinese politics.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\" (mentioned)\n*\"[[Band in China]]\"\n[[fr:Black Panther]]\n[[pl:Czarna pantera]]\n[[zh:黑豹]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Royalty]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]"
