He appears in \"[[Quintuplets 2000]]\", where he was held at gunpoint and forced to ask the U.S. government to return the quintuplets to [[Romania]].\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has messy brown hair, a \"five o'clock shadow\", and a brown mustache. He wears a green, dotted cap, brown coat, and white shirt.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is presumably neglectful, not knowing how to pronounce one of his daughter's names. According to one of the quintuplets, they have not seen him in five years.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is sometimes known as '''Mr. Vladchik''' like the girls' grandmother, but there is no evidence this is their father's side of the family.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[zh:弗拉德契克先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Parents]]"
