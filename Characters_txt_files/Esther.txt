She wears pink gloves as well, being a lighter shade than both her pants and her collar.

She also wore pink blush with blue eyeshadow, similar to [[Red]].\n\nAt the sleepover in \"[[Marjorine]]\", she wore a violet pajama top with a deep purple lace collar and a pair of violet plaid pajama bottoms.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Images of Esther\" widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nMarjorine51.png|Esther in her pajamas at [[Heidi Turner]]'s slumber party in \"[[Marjorine]]\".\nElementarySchoolMusical012.png|Esther dancing with the other girls in \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\".\nSkankHunt00039.png|Esther with a breakup note in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Bradley Biggle]]===\nBradley and Esther were paired up in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\".
