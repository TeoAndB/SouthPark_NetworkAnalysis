He has his first speaking role in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\", where he is referred to as \"Kevin\" by Stan. Despite being animated the same as the white children, he is revealed to be Chinese-American in the episode. Kevin's most notable traits are his ''Star Wars'' and ''Star Trek'' obsessions, seen in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\", \"[[Fatbeard]]\" and \"[[Black Friday]]\". Kevin is described by [[Trey Parker]] as the kid who is \"always screwing up the whole show\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik52lcIw6WM|title=The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers Commentary|publisher=youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nHe has a small role in \"[[Fatbeard]]\", where [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] recruits Kevin and a few other classmates to become pirates and travel to Somalia, and he is critical to taking control of the French vessel that the crew commandeers for the rest of the episode proving they are worthy pirates.\n\nWhile previous appearances had depicted him as a ''Star Wars'' fan who was often playing by himself, in \"[[Black Friday]]\" and ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' he was now seen as a ''Star Trek'' fan and is shown leading the \"Federation Kids\", a clique of kids who play ''Star Trek''-themed games, including [[Dougie O'Connell]].\n\n===Name===\nHe is first referred to by name in \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] as \"Casey\", but is referred to by Stan in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" as \"Kevin\", a name used for many characters in the second season. Since then, he has consistently been referred to as \"Kevin\". \n\nDuring the thirteenth season, a character named Kevin Stoley was referred to off-screen in \"[[Fishsticks]]\" and it was revealed later in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" to be this Kevin. \n\n==Appearance==\nKevin wears a sky-blue jacket with a red collar, red gloves, and dark blue trousers. His hair is black, and the style is similar to that of Stan's. The light blue color of his jacket explains why in the ancient scripts he was written as \"Sky\".\n\n[[Trey Parker]]'s original script for \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" refers to him as looking like \"any other kid, except he has black hair.\" He is identified in dialogue as having Chinese ancestry but nothing in the animation indicates this.\n\nIn terms of attractiveness, Kevin is ranked #9 on the rigged list for the cutest boys, created by the girls in \"[[The List]]\".\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Kevin Stoley}}\n\n==Personality==\nKevin's personality is little-known, but he is known for his ''Sci-Fi'' obsession, which he consistently annoys other characters (mainly Cartman) with - in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" he is wearing a [[Stormtrooper]] mask while meeting with the other children in their Lord of the Rings outfits, and in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" he brings along a green lightsaber instead of a sword as a member of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s pirate crew. Kevin also has a tendency to ruin the moment for the other children, usually with a ''Star Wars'' reference. This will usually exasperate his classmates, but Cartman in particular, who will often respond with, \"Kevin, god damn it.\" or \"Kevin, Jesus Christ.\" An example is in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', where he references Star Trek in an irrelevant situation, \"Let us charge our shields and use photon torpedoes to vaporize the Klingons!\" and Cartman responds, \"Kevin, god damn it, every fucking time Kevin, god fucking damn it seriously.\" This could imply that Kevin isn't only a fan of ''Star Wars'', but movies in the sci-fi genre in general. In the entire \"Black Friday\" trilogy, he plays \"Spock\" from ''Star Trek'', and in ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' he is also seen in the same attire.\n\nThere is a possibility that gaming might be one of Kevin's hobbies, in \"[[Best Friends Forever]]\" Kevin was lined up outside a shop to get a PlayStation Portable, with several other children. Also, in \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]\", it is shown that he is trying to help defeat the high levelled player, though it is impossible to tell which character he is playing as. It would not be odd if Kevin liked gaming, as he loves ''Star Wars''.\n\n==Family==\n===The Brooks===\n[[File:Future_Self_n_Me_Screenshot.jpg|thumb|248px|Mr. and Mrs. Brooks and the hired Kevin decoy.]]\nIn ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' and ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]'', the player can visit the Stoley Residence and see a picture of Kevin with parents who have been seen in the background before  throughout the show.\n\nIn \"[[My Future Self n' Me]]\", a couple known as the Brooks hire a man to keep their son Kevin out of drugs by using him as a \"future self\" decoy. Some fans believe he shares design similarities with Kevin Stoley. The same couple reappear in episodes like \"[[200]]\", \"[[201]] and \"[[T.M.I.]]\" in scenes consisting of mostly parent characters, suggesting they have a child in the fourth grade class.\n\nIt was mentioned in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" by Kevin that he's from America but his parents are from China. None of the adults described here appear to be Asian-American.\n\nHe does not have any siblings as none are ever seen with either of his possible families.\n\n[[File:Kevin_Stoleys_parents.jpg|thumb|The Stoleys, as seen in the video game.]]\n\n==Interactions==\n[[File:K975.png|thumb|150px|Kevin (right) with [[Craig Tucker]], [[Tweek Tweak]], and [[Jason]].]]\nKevin's exact relationships/friendships are virtually unknown due to him only making a handful of speaking appearances, though in a few episodes he is shown sitting at lunch with the main boys.\n\n===[[Red McArthur]]===\nDuring early seasons, Kevin and her were often animated together, sitting together at lunch for most of the first four seasons including during [[Damien Thorn]]'s attack in \"[[Damien]]\", and in \"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\" where they trade fruits. They're also seen together in crowd scenes, talking in \"[[Gnomes]]\" before class starts, and shown at the movies together in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''\n\nDuring \"[[Hooked on Monkey Fonics]]\" he is seen alone at the dance near her while she dances with Token. However, since the first four seasons the two only occasionally appear together in newer episodes such as \"[[Lice Capades]]\", in class in \"[[Fatbeard]]\", and arguably \"[[Super Fun Time]]\". They were together on Wendy's debate team in \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\", Red was also one of the girls hitting on him in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\n\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\" it is revealed that the two had been in a relationship for an unspecified period of time prior to their break up. Kevin is notably shocked and can be seen weeping in the hallway staring at Red's note at the end of the episode.\n\n===[[Bradley Biggle]]===\nDuring Seasons [[Season Nine|9]] to [[Season Thirteen|13]], after the lunch room was re-designed, Kevin was usually seen eating and talking with Bradley in a table near the cafeteria doors, and in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", along with [[Francis]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]. They are also seen together in \"[[Lice Capades]]\", where they are the two boys who hold back [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] during his trial, as well as being the ones to remove his hood. When Bradley was formally introduced in the \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\" story arc, his given personality was also similar to Kevin's - in fact, a ''Star Wars''-esque poster is seen in Bradley's bedroom.\n\n===[[Timmy Burch]]===\nKevin is seen hanging around with Timmy, Bradley, and Francis in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" and later is seen talking with Timmy, along with Jimmy and Pip, in \"[[South Park is Gay!]]\" The two have seldom been seen together since, but it is of note Timmy's special character design causes him to rarely be seen in the background.\n\n===[[Eric Cartman]]===\nLike everyone else in the school, Kevin likely despises Cartman, however he has only shown it once in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" where he cheers for [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] and is seen quite pleased when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is knocked on the ground. Despite this, Kevin has actually aided him on a few occasions. Cartman greatly despises Kevin openly. He had no qualms about accepting Cartman as a leader on numerous occasions, meaning either he is a person who likes to follow orders more than give them, is too passive to fight back, or he trusts Cartman to some extent. In \"[[Fatbeard]]\" Cartman calls the pirate crew meeting at his house, with Kevin expressing surprise. It's unknown if Kevin joined the pirate crew by choice. Cartman is annoyed by Kevin's love of Star Wars, as shown in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\". However, in \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" Cartman is seen hugging Kevin, though Kevin does not return the gesture.\n\n=== [[Jason White]] ===\n[[File:Jason and Kevin.png|thumb|220x220px|\"Holy crap, dude, look at Butters!\"]]\nKevin and Jason were first seen together in \"[[Marjorine]]\". They were later seen standing together for the national anthem in \"[[Wieners Out]]\". They were both at first concerned at what Butters was doing, but later on they took part in his movement. This implied that they were friends until Jason's death.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nKevin Stoley appears in the game as a minor character. He can be found in his bedroom, where he gives the player a side quest which requires finding his dad's iPad. He is also recruited by the humans and elves to participate in the siege on Clyde's fortress, where he once again ruins the moment with a ''Star Trek'' reference.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\n[[The New Kid]] can request Kevin to follow them on [[Coonstagram]] (2 followers required). Otherwise, he can be found in his room interacting with a virtual reality set.\n\n==Prominence==\nDespite having played a major role in only one episode, \"[[Fatbeard]]\", Kevin has made reoccurring appearances as a background character in South Park since [[Season One]], and he has had several speaking roles, his first being in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\".\n\nKevin is abundantly seen in the background of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s classroom, however this is not the case in [[Season Fourteen]], though he can still be seen in the hallways and in the canteen, or in the playground. During the [[Season Seventeen|Seventeenth Season]], Kevin's role as a background character arguably changes to a supporting character, as he is seen consistently in episodes \"[[Black Friday]]\", \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\", and \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\". \n\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Seen in Mr. Garrison's class.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]] \" - Kevin's debut appearance.\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]] \" - Seen in the [[The 4th Grade|classroom]], and portrays a pioneer attacking the Native Americans in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s play.\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - Seen in coach [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]]'s football practice with [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]], and is a bystander in the football game.\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - No lines, but is seen giving his science project, a weed; referred to as \"Casey\".\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Seen in the classroom and in the canteen standing beside the four boys.\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - Seen in Mr. Garrison's classroom.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - He is seen singing \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\".
