The [[Costa Rican President]] sends them on a tour of the rainforest headed by Pablo.\n\nDuring the tour, Pablo shows the choir group various animals in the rainforest. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] sees a coral snake and screams in fear. Pablo mistakenly states that \"they're more scared of us than we are of them\". The snake promptly attacks and swallows him whole, killing him.\n\nFollowing Pablo's death, the group is now lost in the rainforest, very scared. They find themselves in many life-threatening situations until they are rescued by [[Foreman|American builders]]. They make it back to the rainforest summit just in time for their performance.\n\n==Appearance==\nPablo has short black hair, a visible nose and ears, wrinkles on his forehead, and a mustache. He wears a dark blue collared shirt with two chest pockets, a dull green belt with a large buckle, brown pants with knee pockets, and black shoes. He carries a dark green sling bag slung from his left shoulder. He holds a large hunting knife in his left hand, likely to defend himself against danger in the rainforest. He can speak English, unlike the President.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n\n[[zh:巴勃罗]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
