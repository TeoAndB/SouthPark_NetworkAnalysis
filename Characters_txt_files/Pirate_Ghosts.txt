By the end of the episode, [[Korn]] and The Boys set up a trap to capture the Pirate Ghosts. Afterward, it is revealed that [[Father Maxi]] had set up the Pirate Ghosts to scare everyone away from the docks because he didn't want there to be a Halloween. He used a flashlight and a few cotton swabs to create the Pirate Ghosts, a cup and a piece of cheese to create the sound effects, and some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels to create the ghost ship.\n\nThe Pirate Ghosts were also part of an ongoing argument on whether they were actually called Pirate Ghosts or Ghost Pirates.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe Pirate Ghosts all wear typical pirate outfits such as peg legs and eye patches. They also wield swords and have a large ghost ship they use to shoot cannons. They all have a green color scheme and glow. Their overall design is also different from other South Park characters and is designed similar to how Korn is portrayed in the episode.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:海盗幽灵]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
