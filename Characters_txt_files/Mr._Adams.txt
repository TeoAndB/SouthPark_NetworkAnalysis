He made his first appearance in \"[[The Poor Kid]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe was the caseworker for [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and presumably, the other children fostered by [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead]]. Although his aim was to send the children to a better environment than their current one, he realized that it was a mistake sending them to live with [[Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead]], after seeing that one of the children had been water-boarded in [[The Punishment Room]].\n\nHe reappeared in the episode \"[[The City Part of Town]]\" at the [[Whole Foods Market]] along with many rarely seen characters from previous seasons.\n\nIn the video game ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]], ''Mr. Adams appears and offers the player a reward if they post 8 of his headshots around the town. He also appears in the DLC ''[[From Dusk till Casa Bonita]]'', where he is revealed to be [[Mike Makowski]]’s stepdad. When [[Mysterion]] and [[Douchebag|The New Kid]] interrupt Mike‘s birthday party at [[Casa Bonita]] to rescue Kenny’s sister [[Karen McCormick|Karen]], Mr. Adams dresses up as Keifer Sutherland from the 1980s film ''The Lost Boys'' and fights the children.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Adams is a heavy set Caucasian male. He has a full, brown beard and mustache, and wears glasses. He wears olive-colored slacks, a red dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up, a yellow-orange tie, and a plain black belt. \n\n==Personality==\nHe cares for the children whose cases he works although he is naive, trusting foster parents completely. He is softhearted and cheerful and he routinely likes to tell jokes about the [[wikipedia:Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Penn State Scandal]]. When something happens that requires him to be assertive, he is, and when it's time to help the children, he becomes sincerely nice.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Poor Kid]]\"\n*\"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\" - Seen at the back of the Child Protective Services room.\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\"\n*\"[[Bike Parade]]\"\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" bordercolor=\"transparent\" captionalign=\"left\">\nThePoorKid056.png|''\"I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric!
