Cartman used the teeth in order to receive Tooth Fairy money to save for a [[List of Video Game References#Sega Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]]. Dr. Roberts was unable to provide advice to Liane due to the American Dental Association convention.\n\n[[File:HalfChickenHalfSquirel.png|thumb|left|Dr. Roberts describing the creature]]\nAt the convention he spoke to the audience about reports of missing teeth. He provided a farfetched reason, that everyone in the audience, except [[Tom Foley]] took as truth, as to who the culprit of the missing teeth was. He described a giant half-chicken/half-squirrel with a \"mild understanding of algebra\". He also stated that the creature would steal either the money or the teeth from children to build a nest for its dangerous offspring.\n\n==Appearance==\nDr. Roberts wears a light-teal dentist lab coat over a red vest with yellow buttons, which is also over white button shirt with a thin black tie. He is bald, wrinkles on his forehead and chin, and black eyebrows. Roberts' coat has a tag that says ADA, which stands for the [[American Dental Association]]. Roberts also has a dental tool in his coat pocket.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Dr. Roberts\">\nDrRoberts2.png|Dr. Roberts speaking at the American Dental Association convention in \"[[The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000]]\"\nDrRoberts3.png|Dr. Roberts dismissing [[Tom Foley]]'s suggestion about the black market tooth racket\nDrRoberts4.png|Roberts proving his hypothesis was correct\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[zh:罗伯茨医生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Medics]]"
