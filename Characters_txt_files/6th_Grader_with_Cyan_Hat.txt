He was first seen in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Clubhouses]]\". He is the possible older brother of [[Sally Bands]].\n\n==Background==\nHis first major appearance was in \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\" where he, along with the [[6th Grader Leader]] and another [[6th Grader with Brown Hat|unnamed 6th grader]], frighten [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] with the ghost legends, making [[The Boys|the boys]] want revenge.\n\nIn \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\", he along with the other [[The 6th Graders|6th graders]] want to get a [[Back Door Sluts 9|porn film]] that was with the boys. This is the first time we can hear him talking.\n\nHis last featured appearance was in \"[[Pre-School]]\" where he and the other 6th graders promise the boys to protect them from [[Trent Boyett]], but in the end, all fail.\n\n==Personality==\nDespite being one of the three main 6th graders, not much is known about his personality. He was shown to behave the same way as most other 6th graders, like enjoying bullying younger children. Like the other 6th graders, he stopped being a bully in recent episodes, as seen in \"[[Butterballs]]\" where he participates in Stan's anti-bullying video.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe wears a long-sleeved blue T-shirt, a green collar, a cyan hat that is similar to Stan's but without the puffball, matching dark blue pants and gloves and black shoes. He has black hair and black thick eyebrows.\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of The 6th Grader with Cyan Hat\" widths=\"160\">\nGreenhat3.png|The boy with the green hat in \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\".\nGreenhat4.png|The boy with the green hat in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\".\nGreenhat2.png|The boy with the green hat in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\".\nGreenhat1.png|The boy with green hat in \"[[Pre-School]]\".\nGreenhat5.png|The boy with the green hat in \"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\".\nGreen Hat Family.png|The family of the boy with green hat in \"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\".\n6thleader3.png|The boy in ''[[The Unaired Pilot]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[6th Grader Leader]]===\nDuring the early seasons he was quite seen with the 6th grader leader.\n===[[6th Grader with Brown Hat]]===\nHe is widely seen with the 6th grader with brown hat, especially during assembly scenes and on the playground.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" he was seen without his hat in the assembly, revealing his hair color.\n\n==Prominence==\n{{Incomplete|item=list}}\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Seen with [[The Boys]] in the school playground.\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Appears in a cameo role at Cartman's clubhouse party.\n*\"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\" - Antagonizes [[The Boys|the boys]], who later get their retribution by scaring him with [[Cleo Broflovski]]'s corpse.\n*\"[[The Wacky Molestation Adventure]]\" - Seen in Cartman's side of town.\n*\"[[It Hits the Fan]]\" - Seen inside the Airplane.\n*\"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\" - Appears watching [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s video.\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" - Along with the rest of the [[Sixth Graders]], he attempts to gain possession of a hardcore porno, but ultimately fails.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" - Seen running out of the school when it's on fire.\n*\"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\" - Seen watching [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s presentation.\n*\"[[Pre-School]]\" - Promises to defend the boys from [[Trent Boyett]] in return for photographs of [[Sharon Marsh|Stan's mom]]'s boobs, but ends up grievously injured.\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Best Friends Forever]]\" - Seen in line to buy a PSP.\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" - Seen coming out of school.\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\"\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" - Seen singing with the other students.\n*\"[[Funnybot]]\" - Seen in the gymnasium.\n*\"[[City Sushi]]\" - Seen without his hat at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen in the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen briefly during the song \"[[Make Bullying Kill Itself]]\".\n*\"[[Time To Get Cereal]]\" - Seen in the school's playground after evacuation.\n\n===Movies===\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Seen buying tickets to a movie.\n*''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'' - Appears in Kenny's funeral service.\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[zh:绿帽六年级生]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:6th graders]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
