He later appears in \"[[The Entity]]\" as one of the select rich and famous people [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] invites to view the unveiling of \"[[IT]]\". He has band aids over the place where he was previously shot by Plymkin.\n\nHe appears in \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\" to kill [[Steve Ballmer|the CEO of Microsoft]] and take his position as leader of the Xbox One supporters.\n\nIn \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\", he kills [[Kazuo Hirai|the Sony President]], thus winning the \"console war\" for the Xbox One, much to the apathy of the children.\n\nBill Gates appears to own a rather strong private armed force, as we can see him getting off a battleship in \"[[The Entity]]\", and Microsoft cruisers blockading the shipment of PS4s in \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nBill Gates has short, brown hair and few facial wrinkles. In the movie, he wore a light blue, long sleeve shirt and blue pants. He is also shown to have numerous tattoos on his body. In Season 5, he wore a dark pink sweater over a lavender shirt with the same blue pants. In Season 17, He wears a light blue dress shirt, a black sweater-vest with a purple and green diamond pattern, khaki pants, and brown shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nIn \"[[The Entity]]\", he seems to be intelligent, choosing to invest in \"[[IT]]\", potentially knowing it will be a big success.\n\nIn \"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\", he is shown to be a ruthless businessman, willing to do anything to crush his competition.\n\n==Prominence==\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Being executed by shooting due to Windows 98's inadequacy.\n*\"[[The Entity]]\" - One of the barons to attend the release conference of [[IT]].\n*\"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\" - Bill returns to power in Microsoft and becomes the leader of the Xbox One group.\n*\"[[Titties and Dragons]]\" - Bill kills the [[Sony President]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Bill Gates\">\nSouth Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut-24 25674.png|''Boom!''\nBill.PNG|Bill Gates in the \"[[The Entity]]\".\nTitties.and.Dragons090.png|Bill Gates' tattoos in the episode \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\".\nTitties.and.Dragons079.png|Bill Gates' back covered in tattoos in the episode \"[[Titties and Dragons]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters Movie}}\n{{BusinessCelebrities}}\n[[es:Bill Gates]]\n[[fr:Bill Gates]]\n[[pl:Bill Gates]]\n[[zh:比尔·盖茨]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Business celebrities]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]"
