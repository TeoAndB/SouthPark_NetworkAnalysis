During the rally, Gary Nelson checks in on Cartman and does so again when Cartman prepares to kill the non-gingers. Focusing only on his job and not the subject of the meetings, he remains completely oblivious to what's going on.\n\nHe reappears in \"[[The Coon]]\" when Cartman, as The Coon, hosts a convention for himself, which no-one comes to. Gary checks in on Cartman, and questions whether The Coon is actually Cartman. Cartman, maintaining his alter-ego, ensures him otherwise, for which Gary replies, ''\"I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.\"''.\n\n==Appearance==\nGary wears a black suit, consisting of black pants, a black coat, and a white shirt with a red tie. His coat is adorned with a brown nametag with his name. He has short, combed brown hair and no remarkable features.\n\n<gallery>\ngary coon.jpg|Gary welcoming the Coon in \"[[The Coon]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n* \"[[Ginger Kids]]\" - Checks on [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s ginger pride rally.\n* \"[[The Coon]]\" - Checks on Coonicon 09.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}[[zh:加里·尼尔森]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
