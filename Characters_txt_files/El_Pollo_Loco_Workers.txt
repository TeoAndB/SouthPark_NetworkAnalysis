"{{Group\n|name = El Pollo Loco workers\n|image = El Pollo Loco workers.png\n|first = \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\"\n}}\nThe '''[[El Pollo Loco]] workers''' appear in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode \"[[The Last of the Meheecans]]\".\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] (dressed up as \"Mantequilla\") is dropped off to El Pollo Loco by [[Mr. and Mrs. Whipple]], he is taken into the restaurant by the workers. Upon hearing that Butters is \"Mantequilla\", the workers recognize him from posters which [[the boys]] had erected. They then begin to question their place in the [[United States]], misinterpreting Butters' desire to \"cross the border\", which ultimately led them to their decision to return to [[Mexico]].\n\nAlong with Mantequilla, the workers make their way to a nearby hospital, rallying other Mexican workers to return to Mexico as well.\n[[zh:麦疯鸡员工]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
