They also kidnapped [[Ike Broflovski]] later in the same episode. After observing Planet Earth, Visitors came to the conclusion that cows were the most intelligent species on earth.\n\n==Background==\n''[[South Park|South Park's]]'' animators have \"hidden\" visitors in many episodes, although the frequency has decreased as the series has progressed. They poke fun at this practice in \"[[Cancelled]]\" when the receptionist at the proctologists office is a Visitor disguised only in a wig. Then to the sound of percussive music, this Visitor dramatically removes his / her wig. In later seasons, it was a contest for viewers to find where they were hidden.\n\n==Appearance==\nVisitors are typical looking aliens (like Roswell) with gray skin. They are tall and skinny with tear drop shaped heads. They have tall skinny eyes and no noses. They do not wear clothing and do not have any addition distinguishing features. \n{{GallerySubPage|name=Visitors}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Carl is the only named Visitor. He is one of the Visitors that gave Eric Cartman an anal probe. He was new and was accidentally turning cows inside out.\n*The hidden Visitor in \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" on the 'Our Pets' board is also named Carl.\n*The Visitors' language consists of only one word, \"Moo\". This is likely because they studied cows, and learned to imitate their language.\n\n==Prominence==\nIn the show, there is a long running gag of Visitors appearing, hidden in many episodes of the show.\n\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - First Appearance, kidnapped Cartman and Ike; believed cows were smartest life forms on Earth.\n*\"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" - Appeared in Stan's dream of the boys' incorrect memories.\n[[File:Visitors-Planet.png|thumb|right|210px]]\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\" - Seen on their home planet.\n*\"[[Free Hat]]\" - During the trailer for the \"re-release\" of \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\".\n*\"[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]\" - With the other aliens who came for [[John Edward]].\n*\"[[Cancelled]]\" - Viewers of the alien network.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen queuing outside [[Walgreens]], running after the boys for vaccines, and later celebrating with many other characters at the end of the episode.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nIn ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', the Visitors are the main type of enemies during the first night of the game. \n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nThough not prominent in gameplay, an alien does appear in some of the [[The New Kid]]'s \"backstories\" (depending on the powers the player chose), presented by Cartman.
