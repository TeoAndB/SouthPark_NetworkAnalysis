She first appears in the [[Season Nine]] episode, \"[[Free Willzyx]]\" and received her first speaking role in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, \"[[The List]]\".\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[The List]]\", she was attacked by [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail]] when he tried to kick her in the groin, which did nothing, due to [[Eric Cartman]]'s ignorance of the female body. Nelly beats up Butters, giving him a black eye. Another attempt was made in [[Operation Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time]], during which the list was successfully taken from Nelly.\n\n==Appearance==\nNelly has brown hair and parts it into two pigtails. She wears a light green sweater with a picture of a daisy on it and wears dark green trousers.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Images of Nelly\" widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\">\nNellypool.png|Nelly and her family at the [[Denver Sea Park]] in \"[[Free Willzyx]]\".\nTheList04.jpg|Butters kicking Nelly in the crotch in \"[[The List]]\".\nMemberBerries00011.png|Nelly, angry at [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], in \"[[Member Berries]]\".\nDoucheAndADanish00003.png|Nelly getting ready to fight Butters in \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\".\nnelly ring png 2.png|Nelly seen at the Jonas Brothers concert in \"[[The Ring]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nJudging from Butters's injuries, Nelly is able to fight. According to [[Bebe Stevens]], Nelly would never let the boys see the list, so it can be assumed she is trustworthy. Her ability to fight and her loyalty to the List-Making Committee may be the reason she is the keeper of the lists.\n\n==Interactions==\n===List-Making Committee===\nIn \"[[The List]]\", Nelly is a member of the girls list making committee. She is in charge of holding onto and protecting lists from non-members.\n\n===[[Butters Stotch]]===\nIn \"[[The List]]\", Butters tries to take the list from Nelly by kicking her in the crotch. This has little to no effect on her as she questions what he's doing and after the other boys abort the plan he is seen with his arm in a sling and a black eye.\n\nIn \"[[Member Berries]]\" when she called Cartman a \"fat fuck\", Butters laughed really hard.\n\nIn \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" she was about to fight Butters and was waiting for him to pull his pants up, which he refused to do so. It can be assumed that she doesn't like Butters.\n===Boyfriend===\nIn \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\", Nelly was seen kissing an unnamed boy in a story on [[Eavesdropper]]. The story was not expanded upon in the episode, so nothing is known about their relationship.\n\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", Nelly is seen breaking up with [[Francis]] towards the end of the episode.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\n<gallery widths=\"120\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nNellygencard.png|'''[[Nelly (Phone Destroyer)|Nelly]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Free Willzyx]]\" - Seen at the Denver Aquarium with her family.\n*\"[[The List]]\" - As one of the list keepers.\n*\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" - Cheers during the fight between [[Kyle Broflovski]] and Eric Cartman.\n*\"[[Canada on Strike]]\" - As one of the people watching Butters' video on her computer.\n*\"[[Super Fun Time]] \" - Seen as a part of the class field trip as [[Emily]]'s partner.\n*\"[[The Ring]]\" - Seen watching the [[Jonas Brothers]] concert.\n*\"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\" - Seen in the school's playground.\n*\"[[Coon vs. Coon & Friends]]\" - Seen at the [[Justin Bieber]] concert.\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\" - Seen in the hallway, grossed out by the chart of the boys' penis sizes.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Seen during the school assembly.\n*\"[[Faith Hilling]]\" - Seen exiting the school with the other students.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in the background in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Raising the Bar]]\" - Seen during the \"[[Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo]]\" video, where she is knocked over by Cartman's scooter.\n*\"[[Going Native]]\" - Seen at the airport with her mom.\n*\"[[A Scause For Applause]]\" - Seen in the background in the school hallways.\n*\"[[Let Go, Let Gov]]\" - Seen in the school hallways talking to [[Tammy Nelson]] and [[Emily]].\n*\"[[Informative Murder Porn]]\" - Seen in [[Park County Community Center]].\n*\"[[The Cissy]]\" - Seen listening to Lorde's new song with [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] and [[Millie Larsen|Millie]] in Bebe's room.\n*\"[[Cock Magic]]\" - Seen in the hallway and on the volleyball game.\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\" - Speaks at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Conspires with her fellow female classmates to get back at the boys for [[Skankhunt42]]'s wrongdoings.\n*\"[[Wieners Out]]\" - Seen in the stands at the volleyball game.\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen in the battle between the girls and the boys, preparing to fight [[Butters Stotch]].\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Seen in the school assembly.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Seen while Cartman is singing.\n*\"[[Holiday Special]]\" - Seen in the hallway rampaging due to a cancellation of Columbus Day, and seen in the crowd.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Plays in the bouncy house with Wendy at Marcus's birthday party.
