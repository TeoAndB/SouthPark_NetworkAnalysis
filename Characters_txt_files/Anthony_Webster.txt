[[Dildo Shwaggins]] convinces [[Gerald Broflovski]] to join their team of trolls to help the cause against [[TrollTrace.com]].\n\nIn \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\", he attends the secret troll conference held in the [[Airport Hilton]] hotel. After Shwaggins and Gerald coordinate the troll, Webster joins the troll as MLKKK.\n\nIn \"[[Fort Collins]]\", [[Lennart Bedrager]] and [[TrollTrace.com]] are able to successfully identify Webster as an internet troll, and publicly reveal  the internet histories of everyone in Fort Collins, including Webster's. Fleeing unsuccessfully, he is confronted by [[Father and Handicapped Daughter|an angry father of a disabled girl]]. The father, in retaliation for Webster calling his daughter \"R2-D2\", throws a bucket of gasoline on Webster and lights it, burning him alive.\n\n===Office===\nWebster's computer is located in his living room.

Behind him, on his left, is a ficus tree similar to those featured in \"[[Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers]]\".\n\nHe uses an iPhone, and has a chair with an arm attached, giving him the ability to eat a snack without using his hands.\n\n==Appearance==\nAnthony Webster is a young African-American man with longish black hair and buck teeth. His eyes are farther apart than regular South Park characters, giving him an awkward look. He is quiet and soft-spoken, and slightly overweight.
