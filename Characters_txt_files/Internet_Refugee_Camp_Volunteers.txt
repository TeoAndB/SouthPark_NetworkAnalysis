"{{Group\n|name = Internet Refugee Camp Volunteers\n|image = Internet Refugee Camp volunteers.png\n|first = \"[[Over Logging]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Internet Refugee Camp Volunteers''' are members of the Red Cross tasked to manage the [[Internet Refugee Camp]]. They appear in the [[Season Twelve]] episode \"[[Over Logging]]\".\n\n==Background==\nOne main task of the volunteers is to manage the rationing of internet use for all camp refugees. When one exceeds their rationing time, the volunteer on-site will call for the military police, who will then take the user away from the internet station.\n\nOne night, after the volunteers had stowed away the computer for the night, [[Randy Marsh]] sneaks into the office where it is being kept, and begin using the internet all for himself, mostly to search pornographic materials and jacking off to the images or videos. When the volunteers hear a disturbance in the office, they unlocked the room, only to find Randy covered in his own semen.\n\n==Appearance==\nMost volunteers wear a Red Cross uniform, with some wearing helmets. Few others wear a gray vest over their regular clothing.\n[[zh:网络难民营志愿者]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
