"{{South Park character\n|name = Mr. Twig\n|image = Mr-twig.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = None\n|job = Teacher's Assistant\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705967/|title=\"Summer Sucks\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Summer Sucks]]\"\n|final = \"[[Chef Aid]]\"\n}}\n'''Mr. Twig''' was [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s teaching assistant from \"[[Summer Sucks]]\" to \"[[Chef Aid]]\". Since then, he has yet to reappear.\n\n==Background==\nMr. Twig was introduced as [[Herbert Garrison|Herbert Garrison's]] Teaching Assistant at the end of the episode \"[[Summer Sucks]]\", when Garrison couldn't find [[Mr. Hat]]. He wasn't very popular with the students, who continually asked when Mr. Hat was going to come back. He continued being the teaching assistant until the episode \"[[Chef Aid]]\", where someone/something was trying to assassinate Mr. Twig.\n\nAfter getting busted out of jail by Mr. Hat, Mr. Garrison had to choose between Mr. Hat or Mr. Twig. In his only speaking role, Mr. Twig goes on to tell Mr. Garrison to \"Run to him.\", him being Mr. Hat. He then says in a French accent, \"Love isn't a decision, it's a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.\" Mr. Garrison then discards Mr. Twig and he is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:89a.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Mr. Twig on [[South Park (Website)|South Park Studios]].]]\nMr. Twig is just a twig that wears a purple shirt with a pink triangle on its right side.\n\n==Video Games==\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nMr. Twig can be found in the sewers, as a junk item. His description jokingly says he's out of work. He has no other role in the game and thus cannot be befriended unlike Mr. Hat.\n\n===''[[South Park: Phone Destroyer]]''===\nOn [[Big Gay Al]]'s [[Big Gay Al (Phone Destroyer)|card]], there is graffiti on the wall that says, \"Mr. Twig was here!\"\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\" - [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] introduces him to the other residents of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n*\"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" - Seen with Garrison.\n*\"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" - Seen with Garrison.\n*\"[[Clubhouses]]\" - Gives [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] advice.\n*\"[[Cow Days]]\" - Seen with Garrison.\n*\"[[Chef Aid]]\" - Mr. Garrison says goodbye to him upon finding [[Mr. Hat]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*Mr. Twig's shirt features a symbol, which has been historically used to represent homosexuality. It was used in Nazi concentration camp badges to identify male prisoners who were sent there because of their homosexuality. The badge worn by prisoners was a downward pointing pink triangle. Today, the pink triangle symbol has been reclaimed, as it is used inverted as an international symbol of the gay pride and gay rights movement. The use of this symbol on Mr. Twig's shirt is most likely a reference to Mr. Garrison's closeted homosexuality as seen throughout [[Season Two]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Garrisons Teaching Assistants}}\n[[de:Mr. Zweig]]\n[[es:Sr. Rama]]\n[[it:Mr. Rametto]]\n[[ja:小枝君]]\n[[zh:树枝先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Pseudo-characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Alter egos]]\n[[Category:Made-up characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Former school faculty]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
