He has a gray beard and an overall \"wrinkly\" appearance. It was believed, but not yet medically proven, that he had Marfan Syndrome, which causes problems with posture, and as such contributed to an awkward personal appearance.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Images of Abraham Lincoln\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"160\">\nSuperBestFriends069.png|Abraham Lincoln (as a statue) in \"[[Super Best Friends]]\"\nTheRedBadgeOfGayness094.png|Kyle as Abraham Lincoln in \"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\"\nTheList067.png|The Ghost of Abraham Lincoln in \"[[The List]]\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe appears to children in need of motivation, he appeared to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] in \"[[The List]]\", trying to convince him that being ugly is a good thing, and he then tries to motivate Kyle to work, and not burn down the school, hinting at a particular excess of compassion. With these facts, we can assume he is, morally, a good person. While originally maintaining this calm and compassionate demeanor, he was quick to call Kyle a \"fucking asshole\" when Kyle refused to listen to his advice. With these facts, we can assume Abraham Lincoln is a compassionate person but can have his limits for patience when people refuse to heed his lessons. However, it is also possible that this version of Lincoln is based on Kyle's personal view of him.\n\n==Interactions==\n===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===\nHe was shown to care about Kyle's wellbeing in \"[[The List]]\", trying to convince him that being ugly was a good thing because he wouldn't be handed things, and therefore, would have to work, which would allow Kyle to excel in life. He uses the example of one of Jamal, [[the Ugly Kids]], by taking Kyle to Jamal's residence. Abraham tells Kyle that Jamal is well aware that because he is an ugly kid, no one is going to stack the deck in his favor. Peeping inside the window, Kyle saw Jamal playing the piano, to which Abraham Lincoln pointed out that Jamal practices long and hard at this, which will one day likely pay off. Kyle continued to wallow in self-pity; Abraham got fed up with this (since his job was to teach a lesson and he did his job), called Kyle a \"fucking asshole\", and then drove off.\n\n==Quotes==\n*Abraham Lincoln: \"Well then, you're just a fucking asshole!\" from \"[[The List]]\"\n*Abraham Lincoln: \"It was only when she reached age forty, and her looks started to fade, that she realized she was really about as interesting and special as a wet carrot.\" from \"[[The List]]\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*Throughout the series in the Cartman household, an image of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and his mom in front of Mount Rushmore is seen. Lincoln is among the faces.\n*Lincoln was first referenced in \"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\", where Kyle dresses as Abraham Lincoln in order to put an end to the Civil War re-enactment.\n*In the episode, \"[[Super Best Friends]]\", David Blaine animated the Lincoln Memorial and ordered it to destroy the Super Best Friends. The statue was ultimately killed by a statue of [[John Wilkes Booth]].\n*In \"[[Wing]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] \"receives\" a fake phone call from Abraham Lincoln, completely unaware, to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle's]] annoyance, that Lincoln is dead.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\" - [[Kyle Broflovski]] dresses up as him.\n*\"[[Super Best Friends]]\" - Seen as a statue brought to life by [[David Blaine]].\n*\"[[Wing]]\" - [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] pretends to get a phone call from him.\n*\"[[Follow That Egg!]]\" - Seen in a photo of [[Colorado State Capitol]].\n*\"[[The List]]\" - Seen as a ghost to mentor Kyle. So far his only appearance as a character.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n[[es:Abraham Lincoln]]\n[[fr:Abraham Lincoln]]\n[[ru:Авраам Линкольн]]\n[[zh:亚伯拉罕·林肯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Historical celebrities]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
