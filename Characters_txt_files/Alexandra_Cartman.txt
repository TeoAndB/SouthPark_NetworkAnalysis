She made her first appearance at the dinner scene in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", and later appeared in the [[Season Five]] episode, \"[[Cartmanland]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Alexandra in South Park- Bigger, Longer & Uncut.png|left|thumb|Alexandra on the cover of \"[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\"''.'']]\nAlexandra has long brown hair with bangs, and wears black mascara, red lipstick and has some freckles between her eyes. She also wears a white short-sleeved shirt with light brown edges, blue jeans and black shoes. At the end of the episode she is seen wearing a red Christmas hat. Alexandra is the second member of the Cartman family who is not overweight, like her [[Liane Cartman|aunt]]. Actually, if anything she seems to be underweight as she looks the same height as [[Shelly Marsh]], who is exact weight.\n\nIn \"[[Cartmanland]]\", she was wearing a black dress with pink edges.\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to the official script of \"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\", There would be a scene where [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] would wave to Alexandra, she would then roll her eyes. This scene however does not appear in the final episode.\n**Also, she was called Alexandria in this part of the script, this was probably a typo.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!]]\" - Seen eating dinner with her extended family.\n*\"[[Cartmanland]]\" - Seen at the funeral for [[Mabel Cartman]].\n\n{{Cartman Family}}\n[[es:Alexandra Cartman]]\n[[fr:Alexandra Cartman]]\n[[pt-br:Alexandra Cartman]]\n[[ru:Александра Картман]]\n[[zh:亚历山德丽亚·卡特曼]]\n[[Category:Cartman/Tenorman family]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n\n[[Category:Background characters]]"
