He made his first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\". His voice has been provided by many children, usually relatives of show personnel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SouthPark/status/329817845280161792|title=''You may notice Ike's voice changes depending on the episode. That's bc Ike's voice is done by various staff members' kids.''|publisher=@SouthPark on Twitter.com}}</ref> due to their young-sounding voice, as described during the commentary of \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\". He has also been mistaken for both a trash can and a table post, as well as compared to a football. Unlike other Canadians, Ike doesn't have a Canadian accent or a box-shaped body, although that could be because he is so young and has presumably lived in the United States for a majority of his life.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:5a.jpg|thumb|left|Ike on [[South Park Studios]].]]\nIke was adopted by [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] and [[Sheila Broflovski]]. Ike's birth parents, [[Harry and Elise Gintz]] (who christened Ike \"Peter\") gave him up for adoption because Canada had been \"devastated by the Cola Wars\" and as a result, they were unable to raise a child.\n\nThis fact was introduced after the flappy heads and beady eyes were established as Canadian traits in the world of South Park. Since Ike was designed with both, [[Matt Stone|Matt]] and [[Trey Parker|Trey]] decided to make Ike Canadian by birth, and therefore, adopted.\n\nIn the fourth season, it is revealed that Ike is a genius, and is sent to kindergarten early. This wasn't evident at first however, Proof of Ike's genius is visible in many later episodes. He composes sheet music, reads John Steinbeck, and watches \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" every night. In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', he expertly played the harmonica when Kyle hid him in the attic, and in \"[[Smug Alert!]]\", Ike finished several of Kyle's sentences when the boys tried to tell their father that he is becoming alienated from his friends. In the same episode, when offered LSD, Ike asked for \"3 hits\". He also once made a perfect replica of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Last Supper\" painting out of macaroni as a project for his Jewish camp, which completely offended his unimpressed troop leader. In \"[[About Last Night...]]\", he is seen helping [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] steal the Hope Diamond, as a demolition specialist and computer hacker. He can play the piano very well in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" and seems to know how to drive a boat.\n\nIn \"[[Stanley's Cup]]\", the South Park Pee-Wee hockey team hires Ike to join their team based solely on the fact that he is Canadian. To the other members of the Pee-Wee team, Ike seems to be a very good player, due to the fact that he can hit pucks into the goal, while the other members can't.\n\nIke is at times very aware of things going on around him, from trying to reconcile with his brother to auditioning for [[Eric Cartman]]'s [[Fingerbang|boy band]] and flipping Cartman off when he doesn't make the cut. Ike was also aware of how unpopular he initially was with his kindergarten classmates, who were jealous of the fact that he was admitted at only age three. However, he rallied enough support to force a tie in the election for class president, finally winning when his opponent (who was fed up with all the negotiations and meddling by his aunt Rosie O'Donnell) conceded defeat.\n\nIke has falsely attempted suicide twice, once in \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\" and again in \"[[About Last Night...]]\" (but that was only to get to the hospital computers when he was hired by both [[John McCain|McCain]] and [[Barack Obama|Obama]]).\n\nIn the episode \"[[Fatbeard]]\" Ike joins Cartman's pirate crew and goes to Somalia with him because he grew tired of his home life. However, when he and Butters hear the story of a real Somalian pirate, who tells them they shouldn't want to be a pirate and that they should be happy with their lives in America, he wants to go home again. This is one of the first episodes where Ike's dialogue is actively coherent to the audience throughout the entire episode as opposed to nonsensical comments.\n\nKyle is known to punt Ike like a football after saying, \"Kick the baby!\", to which Ike responds, \"Don't kick the (goddamn) baby!\"\n\nBecause he's a genius, Ike was accepted into kindergarten at the age of 3. There, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] nominates him for class president, Ike's opponent being [[Filmore]]. The vote is tied, as a little classmate of theirs named \"Flora\" (spoofing Florida's role in the 2000 US Presidential Election) can't make up her mind and [[Rosie O'Donnell|Filmore's aunt]] shows up to demand that Filmore be declared class president. Eventually, Filmore gives up and Ike becomes class president (to which he can only exclaim (loudly), \"I pooped my pants!\").\n\nAt one point, Ike has an affair with his kindergarten teacher, Ms. Stevenson, during which he loses his virginity, becoming the youngest person on the show to do so. They planned to run off to Milan (to which Ike replies, \"Yay, Mulan!\", confusing Milan with the Disney character [[Mulan]]). Before they leave, Kyle helps him come back to his senses. As Ike and his teacher are on the roof of a hotel, they both run to the edge, but Ike skids to a stop. Ms. Stevenson doesn't and leaps to her death.\n\nIn a plot involving his Canadian heritage, the Canadian Prime Minister, with the help of the Canadian critic (and [[Terrance and Phillip]] nemesis) [[Scott the Dick]], passed a new law forcing Canadian parents to take back children they put up for adoption; this included Ike's birth parents. However, when the Prime Minister was revealed to be [[Saddam Hussein]], his new laws were repealed, and Ike went back to his adopted family.\n\nIn the episode \"Stanley's Cup\", Ike is on a Pee-Wee hockey team coached by [[Stan Marsh]]. He joins the team simply because of the fact that he is Canadian, and thus as a stereotype must be a superior hockey player. During a practice session, he demonstrated shooting skills far beyond those of his teammates. According to Kyle, Ike was not allowed to play because of how dangerous it was and their mother's fears, yet Stan promises that Ike will be okay. However, the team plays in place of the Colorado Avalanche since their intended Pee-Wee opponents didn't show up, and Ike, along with the other children, was injured badly by the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nIke can sing as well, as seen in the episodes \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", where he auditions for the boy band, and \"[[Erection Day]]\", where Ike sings 'The Yankee Doodle Boy' in the talent show.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Canada on Strike]]\", Ike is shown standing up for Canada and holding a sign with the words \"Honk if you support Canada\".\n\nIke has a more grown-up dialogue in \"[[Dead Celebrities]]\", not speaking with his normal childlike voice.\n\nAlso in the episode \"[[About Last Night...]]\" he is the last member of Obama's team to act in their plot, by faking an injury because [[John McCain]] lost, and while he was in the hospital, he performed his tasks by destroying a plane filled with decoys of the presidential candidates and hacking into the hospital's computer to type in Obama and his team deceased, showing a high level of intellect and computer skills.\n\nIn \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", Ike dresses up as in a school play but is crying over the kidnapping of the Princess of Canada. Ike is shown having a Canadian Faith Box, which appears quite old. Ike may have acquired this with his birth or by his biological parents, who took him back to Canada for a short time. In the same episode, Ike is knighted by the princess after he rescues her.\n\nDuring [[Season Twenty]], Ike is being constantly used by his father to troll under the name of [[Skankhunt42]] when he is stuck in [[Denmark]], because of the fact he is too young for someone to believe him. In \"[[Members Only]]\", as Gerald guides him to put a penis in a woman's mouth, his mother finds out and assumes he is the Skankhunt. When she contacts her husband, he ditches Ike and acts like Ike is the real troll. As he is being sat on the corner, Kyle realizes that it wasn't him but their father. Until \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\" when Sheila finds out Ike wasn't really the troll using [[TrollTrace.com]], Ike and Kyle try multiple times to run away or use the computer for several reasons until driving their mother completely insane, and finally locking her in the pantry to finish the job.\n\n===Name===\nAccording to his [[Harry and Elise Gintz|birth parents]] in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", Ike's birth name is Peter Gintz. In \"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\", it is revealed that his full name is Ike Moisha Broflovski, as written on his grave. Ike is short for the Hebrew name Isaac.\n\n==Appearance==\nIke is easily recognized by his baby body, small beady eyes, the standard flopping Canadian head, and a short tuft of black hair. He wears a blue onesie, with white ovals on the bottom of the feet area. Instead in \"[[Insecurity]]\" and \"[[Christmas Snow]]\" he wears a white onesie with pink trim, blue cuffs and pink, yellow and blue circles (similar to [[Butters Stotch]]'s). He has also been shown wearing a green shirt with a boat on it and black shorts. It is mentioned in \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" that he has freckles. Unlike most [[Canada|Canadians]], Ike has a visible nose.\n\n==Personality==\nIke appears to idolize his older brother. He has often tried to follow him to school as shown in \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" and \"[[Cancelled]]\". He often copies the words Kyle has said, even obscenities, as shown in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Conversely, one of the few examples of Ike getting angry at Kyle occurred when Kyle interrupted Ike's news program and changed the channel. Kyle has superficial malice towards Ike, but in several episodes, most notably \"[[Ike's Wee Wee]],\" it's shown that Kyle does indeed love his brother. In \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\", Ike was angry with Kyle because he tried to break up his relationship with the Kindergarten teacher. Furthermore, he is clearly heard saying, \"You are dead to me, Kyle!\"\n\nIke often tries to pronounce words but fails. However, in the episode \"[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]\", he can say, \"penis\" and \"vagina\" quite clearly and in \"[[Cancelled]]\" he tells Kyle to \"suck my balls\". Despite his intelligence, Ike often replies to questions with random answers. Some of Ike's random statements are ''\"cookie monster,\"'' ''\"Ring Around the Rosie,\"'' ''\"I pooped my pants,\"'' ''\"I don't like medicine,\"'' and various nonsensical burbling. Statements like these tend to serve as catch-all phrases and non sequitur answers to questions Ike is asked. Even in a heated argument with Kyle in \"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,\" Ike can clearly be heard saying, \"Ring Around the Rosie!\" in an angry tone.\n\n==Family==\n\n===[[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] and [[Gerald Broflovski]]===\n\nIke is the adopted child of Sheila and Gerald Broflovski. They have been shown to love him very much, becoming extremely upset when he was taken back to Canada in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\". He seems to love them as well, originally not wanting to go back to Canada with his biological parents.\n\n===[[Harry and Elise Gintz]]===\n\nHarry and Elise are Ike's birth parents. In \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", they are shown to love Ike very much. However, this love is one-sided; Ike doesn't seem to love them back.\n\n===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===\n\nIke is the younger, adopted brother of Kyle. He seems to idolize Kyle, copying his words and actions. They have had falling outs before; however, as of recent seasons, they seem to be on good terms, however, on [[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]], their relationship has become very strained because of Ike having a sexual relationship with his kindergarten teacher and which cause Kyle to tell Cartman and have her arrested, much to Ike's anger.\n\n==Quotes==\n*Ike: \"Cookie Monster!\" in \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\"\n*Ike: \"Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!\"\n*Ike: \"Fags!\" (referring to Harley-Davidson riders who interrupted his xylophone playing in \"[[The F Word]]\")\n*Ike: \"Don't kick the [goddamn] baby!\"\n*Ike: \"You are dead to me!\"\n*Ike: \"I thought I were!\" (in the episode \"[[The Entity]]\")\n*Ike: \"I don't like medicine!\"\n*Ike: \"I said 'You're dead to me'\" (this quote marks the start of Ike's dialogue becoming more actively coherent. Episode: \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\")\n*Ike: \"Boom baby!\" (in the episode \"[[About Last Night...]]\")\n*Ike: \"Stop being a dick, Scott!\" (in the season 15 episode \"[[Royal Pudding]]\")\n*Ike: \"Daddy called you a pussy.\" (in the episode \"[[Oh, Jeez]]\")\n*Ike: \"Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch.\" (in the episode \"[[Not Funny]]\")\n*Ike: \"Yay Mulan\" (in the episode \"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\")\n*Ike: \"You are all dumbass fuckwads. Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch.\" (in the episode \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\")\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is the youngest character in South Park to have had consensual sex in \"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\". This spot was previously held by [[Jimmy Valmer]], who had sex with a [[Nut Gobbler|prostitute]] in \"[[Erection Day]]\".\n*On the broken Ike Doll's gravestone in \"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\", it says that he was born in 1996 because the episode was aired in 1998.\n*As seen in \"[[Make Love, Not Warcraft|Make Love, Not Warcraft\"]], Ike has a ''World of Warcraft'' user account.\n*Ike is the first Canadian character to appear on ''South Park'', although his origins were not revealed until the [[Season Two]] episode \"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\", though \"[[Death]]\" gives one the impression that Ike is Canadian since [[Terrance and Phillip]], who have the same flappy heads and beady eyes, are.\n*At the end of \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\", he managed to get his hands on the [[Diamond of Pantheos]], and transformed into Mecha-Ike. The ramifications of this are unknown, and everything was back to normal by the next episode.\n*Ike is a Knight in [[Canada]].\n*Ike was the first non-main character to appear in the show. \n*Ike is shown to be extremely loyal as the show goes on; he stands by Kyle and wishes to stay with him and his family in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", and he goes to save the Canadian princess when she is kidnapped by [[Tooth Decay]].\n*Ike is shown to be very strong for his age, as he cut through the chains that held The Canadian Princess in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\" with almost no effort whatsoever.\n*Ike can get in trouble sometimes as seen in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' when Kyle breaks two windows by kicking Ike through them and [[Sheila]] gets mad and blames him for it. In \"[[Jewbilee]]\", Ike kept trying to take off his squirt uniform, but Sheila tells him to behave.\n*Ike is shown to know about \"[[Ugly Bob]]\" and his hideous deformity in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", and how one glance can turn a person to stone, as he does so with Tooth Decay. How he knew of Ugly Bob's ability is unknown.\n*Ike is said to have freckles in \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\", but they are never seen.\n*Ike in \"[[Taming Strange]]\" is shown to have a slight Canadian accent, most likely due to the fact he has lived in South Park most of his life.\n*Ike is shown to not like Cartman as in \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", he flips Cartman off after being rejected. However, in \"[[Fatbeard]]\", he joins Cartman's pirate crew, and in \"[[REHASH|#REHASH]],\" he becomes a fan of Cartman's online persona [[CartmanBrah]].\n*In [[REHASH|#REHASH]] and [[HappyHolograms|#HappyHolograms]], Ike likes to watch PewDiePie and ignores Kyle when he informs him that he got the new Call of Duty, telling him 'Maybe later, okay?' to watch PewDiePie playing CoD Advanced Warfare.\n*Ike has watched ''Naruto'' on CrunchyRoll, searched up 'Undertale' and 'Yuuri on Ice', viewed 'Chinpokomon Sun & Moon', and streamed ''The Amazing World of Gumball'', as shown on his browsing history in \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\". He also appears to be a bit of a [[Taylor Swift]] fan, since he watched \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Bad Blood\" on YouTube.\n*Ike was originally going to follow [[The Boys]] to the battlefield scene of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', as it was seen in early trailer footage and promotional screencaps of the film. However, his role was subsequently cut down and he was removed from all later scenes, but the attic scene ended up being added in order to explain his absence.\n*Ike has the most voice actors out of all characters.\n*Ike has rarely been seen wearing his blue pajamas in recent seasons.\n*Ike is the youngest sibling of the [[The Boys|boys]].\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Unaired Pilot]]\" - Same role as the first official episode.\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - He was abducted by Visitors.\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - He was seen dancing on the stairs of the bleachers.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - He was set on fire.\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]] \" - He decapitates a turkey with a wooden sword.\n*\"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\" - Finds the [[Diamond of Pantheos#The Triangle of Zinthar|Triangle of Zinthar]] in the trash and turns into a giant.\n*\"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\" - The boys try to save him from being circumcised.\n*\"[[Chickenpox]]\" - Seen with his mother.\n*\"[[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]]\" - Seen following Kyle at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[Jewbilee]]\" - He was in the Jew squirts and tried to help the leader hunt down an angry bear.\n*\"[[Chinpokomon]]\" - Seen in the living room with his parents.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]\" - Kyle Teaches Ike how to play Dreidel.\n*\"[[Are You There God?

If the player interacts with him, he will yell \"I am a pirate king!\". Ike doesn't react if the player attacks or farts on him. \n\nWhen battling with Kyle, the famous \"Kick the Baby\" is used as an attack. When laying siege to Clyde's fortress, Ike tries to launch a firework but is stopped by a cyclops. The player can launch the firework for him (which kills the Cyclops) and Ike befriends him.

If done correctly, Ike will fly at the opponent holding two knives.\n\nDuring the game's early design changes Ike one draft had a design to have him be a dwarf, which a boss fight would've occurred of him riding a bat with a background taken place in a cave. A second Elf Warrior design for Kyle's first move, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Ufja-ljUc&feature=youtu.be&t=107 (Summon Elemental)], had him be an elf warrior though this was changed back to the Maplebeard design used in the open world.\n\nAnother draft had Ike riding a long mower as a dragon for a boss against the new kid at the battle of Kyle's backyard. This would've happened after the new kid defeated Bill and Fosse to rescue Wendy (referring to her as a witch.)\n\nDuring one of the last drafts Ike would've requested the player to visit Canada instead of the girls, when recruiting them for Clyde's fortress. Reason being explained by one of the pirates, \"He wants the Canadian Government to adjust its fiscal spending to compensate for the 10 percent decrease in jobs for the education system in the seven provinces of Canada.\"\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nSotbetapirates1.png|Temp pirates explaining the old draft of Ike's request to visit Canada. \nUntitled_(2).jpg|Beta Ike as seen in the Stick of Truth's Launch Trailer.\nIkeDragonCombat.png|The fight sequence between Ike and the new kid at Kyle's Backyard (beta)\nIkeDragongcomingout.png|The Dragon coming out once the new kid rescues Wendy (beta.)\n</gallery>\n\n===''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''===\nIke is seen at the [[Broflovski Residence]].
