"{{South Park character\n|name = Mountain Lion Cubs\n|image = lion-cubs.png\n|race = Mountain Lion\n|hair = Light Brown\n|voice = [[Dante Alexander]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2543035/|title=Dante Alexander on IMDB}}</ref>\n|relation1 = Mother\n|relativename1 = [[Mountain Lion]]\n|appearance = \"[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Mountain Lion Cubs''' are the children of the [[Mountain Lion]] killed by [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] in \"[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]] is forced into looking for and killing the [[Mountain Lion]] that the [[Woodland Critters]] say keeps eating the virgin critter every Christmas. After Stan kills their mother the cubs walk up to her body begging for her not to leave them and begin to cry. Stan realizes what he has done and feels extremely guilty.\n\nWhen Stan goes back to the Woodland Critters he is informed that their \"savior\" is the Anti-Christ, the Son of [[Satan]]. With some nagging from the narrator, Stan goes back to tear down the manger he built for the critters, but is stopped by their Satanic powers. The narrator reminds Stan of the three cubs that are still up on the hill, so Stan heads there for some help. The cubs tell him that they cannot kill them because they are still just babies with baby teeth and little claws. Stan then takes the cubs to learn how to perform an abortion at a [[Unplanned Parenthood Clinic|Clinic]].\n\nWhen they go back they find out that the Anti-Christ was already born and that the critters are going to use [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] as a vessel. It turns out that this is a story written by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] during [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison's]] class. Kyle does not want Cartman to continue because he thinks it is just another way for Cartman to make fun of him for being Jewish on Christmas. The students egg him on and Kyle finally lets Cartman continue with his story.\n\nKyle gets possessed by the Anti-Christ; Stan comes up with an idea to salvage the situation. He asks the cubs to perform an abortion on Kyle through his anus. They successfully do so and [[Santa Claus]] (who arrived earlier and killed the Woodland Critters with a shotgun) smashes the Anti-Christ with a mallet. He then goes to the mountain lions' lair and brings their mother back to life. The cubs are happy at the end with their mother being alive once more and Stan goes home for Christmas.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey all share the same appearance. They have childlike faces, blonde fur (which varying in tint among the three cubs), Black and White ears, Brown spots, and tufts of White hair on the top of their heads.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the mountain lion cubs\">\nWCC42.png|The Mountain Lion Cubs crying over their [[Mountain Lion|mother's]] death.\nWCC52.png|''\"No, it's okay.
