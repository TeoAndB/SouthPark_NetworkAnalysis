She made her first appearance in the [[Season Eight]] episode, \"[[Quest for Ratings]]\". She later appears prominently in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", where she was seen participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad. She is now mostly seen as a background character.\n\n==Appearance==\nKelly has blonde hair, put in two pigtails. She wears a pink jacket, purple pants, a yellow scarf with green stripes, and two pink-beaded hair ties. As a \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\", she wore a pink and black brassiere, a black tube top, a short, a blue skirt with white stars and a white line around it, black mascara, cyan eye shadow, two purple-beaded hair ties, and white shoes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"120\" caption=\"Images of Kelly Pinkerton-Tinfurter\">\nkellypinkertontisfurter3.png|Kelly as a \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\nSSWVP47.png|Another shot of Kelly as a \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\", with [[Heidi Turner]] and [[Token Black]].\nSSWVP60.png|Kelly chasing [[Kyle Broflovski]] in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\".\nKellyPT-TheCityPartOfTown.png|Kelly in \"[[The City Part of Town]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nDue to her relatively short speaking role, little is known about her personality. In \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", she was seen at [[Bebe Stevens]]' party, rubbing her hand on [[Token Black]] in a hot tub and later chasing [[Kyle Broflovski]]. However, since she was participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad, we cannot interpret any accurate personality traits from these facts.\n\n==Prominence==\n{{Incomplete|item=list}}\n*\"[[Quest for Ratings]]\" - Seen at [[Middle Park Elementary]].\n*\"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" - Seen participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad.\n*\"[[Wing]]\" - Seen watching [[Token Black]] singing at the beauty pageant.\n*\"[[Ginger Kids]]\" - Seen in hallways; background only.\n*\"[[Free Willzyx]]\" - Seen in the aquarium.\n*\"[[The Return of Chef]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\" - Seen in the school hallway.\n*\"[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" - Seen at the park after [[Dr. David Nelson|Dr.Nelson]] and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s fight.\n*\"[[Night of the Living Homeless]]\"- Seen at the park.\n*\"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\"- Seen at [[Whistlin' Willy's]].\n*\"[[The List]]\" - Seen in the background walking in the hallway.\n*\"[[Eek, A Penis!]]\" - Seen in hallways; background only.\n*\"[[Major Boobage]]\" - Seen at the park watching [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] and [[Gerald Broflovski|Gerald]] fighting each other while they were intoxicated.\n*\"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" - Seen watching the fight; background only.\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" - Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[The Ungroundable]]\"- Seen in the hallway.\n*\"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\" - Seen playing at recess; background only.\n*\"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" - Seen briefly in the [[South Park Elementary|school]] cafeteria and in the classroom.\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen in the chocolate factory.\n*\"[[Crippled Summer]]\" - Seen in the crowd of mentally disabled children at the summer camp.\n*\"[[T.M.I.]]\" - Seen in the hallways; background only.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Shown in the gym, background only.\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in Stan's anti-bullying video.\n*\"[[I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining]]\" - Seen in the background at the park.\n*\"[[Black Friday]]\"\n*\"[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]\" - Seen as a member of the group that wants to get Xbox Ones on Black Friday.\n*\"[[Titties and Dragons]]\"\n*\"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" - Seen at [[The Boys|the boys]]' big party, talking to [[Molly]].\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - Briefly seen in the commercial for \"The Villas at Kenny's House\".\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\"- Seen watching [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]'s \"breakup\".\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\"- Briefly seen at the volleyball game.\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen in the battle between the girls and the boys.\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen in a photograph on the wall of [[Heidi Turner|Heidi's]] bedroom.\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Seen in the assembly.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Seen while Cartman is singing.\n*\"[[Holiday Special]]\" - Seen in the hallway rampaging due to a cancellation of Columbus Day.\n*\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\" - Seen in the hallway walking hand in hand with a boy, presumably her boyfriend.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Rallies with [[Marcus Preston]] after witnessing his presentation in the [[South Park Elementary|school]] cafeteria.\n*\"[[Doubling Down]]\" - Seen watching the fight between Cartman and Kyle.\n*\"[[Moss Piglets]]\" - Seen in the school hallway.\n*\"[[SUPER HARD PCness]]\" - Seen in the hallway evacuating to the gym.\n*\"[[The Problem with a Poo]]\" - Seen in the assembly.\n*\"[[Let Them Eat Goo]]\" - Seen in the cafeteria.\n*\"[[Board Girls]]\" - Joins Dice Studz with Nichole and Tammy.
