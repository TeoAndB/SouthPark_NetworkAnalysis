They appear in [[Season Two]] episode \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe players are known to have trained in dodgeball all their lives, going through strict regimentation and using heavy equipment to aid them (e.g. passing 1600-pound balls, knocking down brick walls with their throws). They were also administered steroids to boost their training.\n\nDuring their match against the South Park Cows, they easily took down most of the Cows (including killing [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]), but were later defeated single-handedly by [[Pip Pirrip]].\n\n==Appearance==\nIn dodgeball matches, the players wear red jerseys with yellow sleeves, red shorts, and large straw hats. Each player has a unique number at the front and back.\n\nDuring training, some players wear red or yellow tangzhuangs with blue pants, while keeping their straw hats.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n[[fr:Chinese Dodgeball Players]]\n[[zh:中国躲避球队]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Asian characters]]\n[[Category:Chinese characters]]\n[[Category:Sports teams]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
