The boys charge Steven Spielberg and George Lucas with \"raping\" [[Indiana Jones]], and literally their childhood memories.\n\nStormy Weathers takes the case after the children plead and cry, reminding him that he felt the same way about the movie.\n\nTaking the case to court, they win when everyone agrees that the latest ''Indiana Jones'' movie was a rape.\n\n==Appearance==\nStormy Weathers wears a blue suit consisting of blue pants, a blue coat, and a white shirt with a red tie.
