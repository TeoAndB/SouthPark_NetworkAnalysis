An image of Abe appears in the [[Season Eighteen]] episode, \"[[Handicar]]\", when news of the Wacky Races being called upon broke out.\n\n==Background==\nIt was reported that Shinzo Abe insisted any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. However should the race gets the go-ahead, they would participate with their completely self-driven prototype Lexus. The self-driven car eventually made its way into the race.\n[[zh:安倍晋三]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Mentioned-only characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]"
