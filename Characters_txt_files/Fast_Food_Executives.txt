They appeared in [[Season Fifteen]] episode \"[[Ass Burgers]]\".\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the success of [[Cartman Burger]], several fast food chains see a drop in sales. The executives gathered to discuss the secret behind Cartman's burgers, drafting a theory that the ingredients from all their restaurants were infused into the burger. During their discussion, [[Stan Marsh]] barged into the room, drunk in Jameson Irish Whiskey. The executives had Stan tied up, believing that he was a representative of Cartman Burger, and started interrogating him about the secret ingredient.\n\nLater, the executives had Stan visit the burger stand and ask [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] (who then had an estranged relationship) about the secret ingredient. This went into failure, with the executives losing patience and starting storming the burger stand. As the McDonald's executive was about to unveil the room that holds the secret, he was shot down by the Asperger's freedom fighters. All other executives were also gunned down.\n[[zh:快餐企业代表]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
