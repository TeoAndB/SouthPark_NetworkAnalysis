She later appears prominently in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", as one of the girls participating in the \"Stupid Spoiled Whore\" fad. She has since become a regular background character.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe has brown hair, it's style is similar to [[Emily]]'s hair. In fact, Kelly seems to be a recolor of Emily.
