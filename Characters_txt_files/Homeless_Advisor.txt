Later on, [[The Boys]] go to the advisor's home to get some information about homeless people. He is shown to have gone through several experiments with the homeless, including dissecting them and depriving them of any change. After a group of homeless people, including [[Gerald Broflovski]], break into his house, he tells The Boys to get to [[Evergreen]] and attempts suicide by a gunshot to the head. This somehow fails, but he repeatedly tries shooting himself again, just for each shot to fail at killing him. He eventually dies after shooting himself in the heart several times.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe homeless advisor has medium-length brown hair that appears to be graying slightly in some spots and has brown eyebrows. He wears a gray button-up shirt over a white shirt, a black belt, black pants, black shoes, and a pair of small reading glasses.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:流浪汉问题专家]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
