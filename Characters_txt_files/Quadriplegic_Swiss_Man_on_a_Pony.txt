He wears green pants, a white shirt, black suspenders, and a green hat with a red feather in it, in what is intended to be a stereotypical Swedish outfit. He also wears a Channel 4 News badge on his shirt.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[zh:马背上四肢残缺的瑞士人]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:News reporters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]"
