This assertion is challenged, however, by other [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] residents when Sparky's homosexual nature manifests; first with [[Sylvester]] and then with [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]]'s dog, [[Rex]].\n\n==Background==\nSparky seems to not wait for consent from other male dogs and instead proceeds to jump upon them and have sexual intercourse with them, much to the humiliation and confusion of the other dogs. Sparky also had a brief physical encounter with the mail-ordered female poodle, [[Fifi]], but his only interest in Fifi was her diamond-studded collar.\n\nOverhearing Stan repeating an anti-gay tirade, first heard from [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], a heartbroken Sparky runs away to the shelter of [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]]. Sparky enjoyed the idea of being accepted for who he was, but still missed Stan immensely. Stan too missed Sparky, and forgoing his responsibilities with the school football team, went in search of Sparky. Stan managed to locate the Big Gay Animal Shelter and Sparky was soon found and returned to Stan. Initially, Stan intends to help Sparky overcome his homosexuality, but [[Big Gay Al]] realizing that Stan still doesn't get it, has the two of them ride his Big Gay Boat Ride, where Stan learned that being gay is okay.\n\nSparky's next appearance was in \"[[Spookyfish]]\" where he was seen digging up one of Sharon's dug up bodies.\n\nSparky then appeared in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" in which Stan proceeds to masturbate him, thinking that he's playing a game he learned from [[The 6th Graders]], called \"Red Rocket\", in which one 'milks the dog'. Sparky, however, did not get to climax and was left to run off, still aroused.\n\nSparky next suffered for the irresponsibility of Stan and [[The Boys|the boys]] when they threw a throwing star into the eye of [[Butters Stotch]] in the episode, \"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\". Rather than take Butters to the hospital, they shaved Sparky of his fur and glued it to Butters, with the intention of taking him to the vet under the disguise of a dog, and to avoid getting in trouble for playing with weapons. Sparky was obviously not pleased with the abuse.\n\nHe has a small cameo in \"[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]\" when Stan returns home at the end of the episode.\n\nSparky is mentioned once in \"[[Follow That Egg!]]\", when [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] said she found Stan's and her egg in his dog's mouth.\n\nSparky makes his first appearance in the series 12 years later, in the [[Season Twenty]] episode \"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\". He is briefly seen at the end of the episode with the Marsh family as they are watching the news.\n\n===Behind the Scenes===\nSparky was originally voiced by actor [[George Clooney]]. In interviews, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] have stated that they have invited major celebrities to voice minor characters in the pursuit of creating layers of irony on the show.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nSparky appears as one of Stan's attacks, in which he uses a laser pointer to direct Sparky to the enemy to lower the enemy's defense. When you choose Cartman's side when attacking the school, Sparky appears as an enemy in Stan's boss battle. When Stan's health is low, Sparky starts licking him and Stan regains part of his health. During the final boss battle, he is seen dragging the Nazi zombie unicorn's head after Stan chops it off.\n\n==Appearance==\nSparky is a dog with brown fur. He has a dark brown face and dark brown paws.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Sparky\" captionalign=\"left\">\nFamily_photo.png|A family photo with Sparky, seen in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\".\nSparkyRaisinscameo.png|A picture of Stan and Sparky in \"[[Raisins]]\".\nSparky.jpg|Sparky's original appearance.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - Stan tries to force Sparky to be straight.\n*\"[[Spookyfish]]\" - Digs up the dead bodies Sharon Marsh had buried in the backyard.\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Stan masturbates him.\n*\"[[Fun with Veal]]\" (cameo) - Seen in a photo in Stan's bedroom.\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" (cameo) - Seen in a family photo.\n*\"[[My Future Self n' Me]]\" - Seen in a drawing of Cartman's plan of vengeance.\n*\"[[Raisins]]\" \n*\"[[Good Times with Weapons]]\" - [[The Boys]] shave his fur off and glue it onto Butters.\n*\"[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]\" - Seen when Stan arrives home.\n*\"[[Follow That Egg!]]\" (Mentioned only) - [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]] mentions that she the egg which she and Stan were supposed to care of inside his mouth.\n*\"[[The End of Serialization as We Know It]]\" - Seen watching the news with his family.\n*\"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" - Seen in a photo in [[Marvin Marsh|Marvin's]] bedroom.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Marsh Family}}\n{{South Park Families}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season One}}\n[[es:Sparky]]\n[[it:Sparky]] \n[[ja:スパーキー]]\n[[pt-br:Sparky]]\n[[zh:斯帕克]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Kern / Kimble / Marsh Family]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]"
