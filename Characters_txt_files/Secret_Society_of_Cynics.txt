They are a group of freedom fighters who set out to destroy the illusory world as they see it, which is literally full of shit. The Cynics' headquarters is located at the [[Asperger's Research Center]]. They claim that the deception pervading the world was caused by, as they say, \"aliens, robots from the future, or whatever, fuck you\". The leader, and other patients, look and act similar to Morpheus and some of the various other characters from ''The Matrix'' films.\n\nThey recruit [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] into their group therapy for persons with [[Asperger Syndrome|Asperger syndrome]], only to tell him the secret of coping with the \"world of illusion\" is to drink alcohol. Most of their members were killed at Kyle's residence while fighting the fast-food corporations while being drunk.\n\nThe Cynic Leader, the one who is dressed like [[Morpheus]], from ''The Matrix'' series, is seen at first as a counselor or doctor, as he talks to [[Sharon Marsh]] about Asperger syndrome.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:AssBurgers080.png|thumb|left|The Cynics ambush The Restaurant Chain at Cartman Burger.]]\nEach member of the Cynics has an appropriate counterpart in the Matrix trilogy, such as Morpheus, Trinity, and Niobe. They each dress in mostly black clothing, have exaggerated hair styles, and wear dark sunglasses.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Morpheus character is voiced by [[Trey Parker]]. <ref name=imdb>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2066663/|title=\"Ass Burgers on IMDB}}</ref>\n*The other characters in the Cynics are voiced by both Trey Parker and [[Matt Stone]]. <ref name=imdb/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[zh:愤世者神秘社]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
