The researchers review the video as a group and come to the conclusion that it was actually of a real Jewpacabra, after converting it to infrared and adding a picture of a rottweiler next to the arm.\n\nMr. Billings, wanting to maintain a fun and safe environment for the Easter egg hunt, decide to use Cartman as a sacrifice for it. Cartman is chained to a concrete block, forced to wear a bunny costume, and drenched with chicken blood.\n\nBelieving they sighted a three-foot-tall \"bunny man\", the researchers shoot Cartman with a tranquilizer gun. Having successfully sedated Cartman, they leave the park with the goal of having a show on Animal Planet using their dart gun as evidence.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:BigFootResearchers2.png|thumb|The \"researchers\" at the Easter egg hunt site.]]\nThe researcher with red hair wears a black shirt under a large blue jacket, black pants, and black shoes. He has a thick red beard.\n\nBobo wears a white shirt under a gray sweater under a green jacket. He has brown hair and also wears a dark gray fur hat, blue pants, and large brown boots.\n\nThe researcher with gray hair wears a white shirt under a blue jacket, tan pants, and dark brown boots. He has gray facial hair.\n\nThe researcher with the pink jacket wears a red shirt, black pants, and a blue chullo hat. She has dark brown hair and also wears large brown boots.\n\n==Personality==\nThe Bigfoot researchers all appear to be intellectually disabled. They display many speech impediments and their handicap is shown in their mouths. They are evidently very unintelligent, naïve, and gullible, given how they passionately believe in the existence of mythical and fictitious creatures despite the complete lack of scientific evidence to prove such absurdities.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Bigfoot researchers are a parody of the team from the Animal Planet program ''Finding Bigfoot''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n[[es:Investigadores de Pie Grande]]\n[[fr:Bigfoot Researchers]]\n[[zh:《寻找大脚怪》节目组]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]"
