He also has various facial wrinkles. He wore a black coat, a gray dress, and black pants.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Michael Richards\">\nWithApologiesToJesseJackson072.png|''\"Leave, now.\"''\nWithApologiesToJesseJackson074.png\nWithApologiesToJesseJackson084.png|Michael and [[Randy Marsh]] attempting to get the word \"n****r-guy\" banned by Congress.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe seemed to be intelligent, even being able to devise a plan to get the word \"n****r-guy\" banned. He also appears to be easily offended, though, as the only reason he wanted \"n****r-guy\" banned was that people were using it to discriminate against him.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Richards is known for his infamous racist remarks made during the 2006 Laugh Factory incident where he angrily uses the n-word in his stand-up show and after an African American audience heckled him. This incident brought about the idea of producing \"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n\n[[zh:迈克尔·理查兹]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
