Eric Roberts, who is by this point considered washed up as an actor, assumes the role of Kevin. To the crew's annoyance, Eric improvises his own lines as the reenactment is being filmed, as Kevin is known to be a silent character.\n\nWhen the power goes out, Eric is snowed in along with everybody else who participated in the reenactment. [[Jimbo Kern]] suggests that they resort to cannibalism so that the majority of them may survive the ongoing snowstorm outside. Despite their initial reluctance to resort to this absurd plan, they all agree to eat Eric Roberts, as Mayor Mcdaniels says, \"nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts\". Eric pleads for mercy but is ultimately eaten by his fellow actors.\n\nBy the time the snowstorm ends, Roberts and most of the crew have been consumed, but the residents of South Park have survived. Everybody is ashamed of their actions, with the exception of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], who brings some of Eric Roberts home in a doggy bag.\n\nIn the episode \"[[200]]\", Roberts is among the many other celebrities teaming up for revenge against the town of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], despite him and other seen having died in his previous appearance.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn his first appearance, Roberts wore a yellow Hawaiian shirt decorated with a floral pattern and brown trousers, in recreation of Kevin Mephesto's wardrobe.\n\nIn \"[[200]]\", he appeared less tanned and wore a lighter colored Hawaiian shirt (with the same floral pattern) and black trousers. His hair color also changes from black to brown in between his two appearances.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Eric Roberts\">\nCartmansMomIsStillADirtySlut68.png|Roberts' remains at the end of \"[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]\".\nEric_Roberts200.png|Eric Roberts in \"[[200]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', a movie poster of him can be seen when the boys were leaving the theater.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" - Stars in a reenactment of [[Dr. Alphonse Mephesto|Dr. Mephesto]]'s shooting.\n*\"[[200]]\" - As one of the many celebrities suing [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n[[es:Eric Roberts]]\n[[zh:埃里克·罗伯茨]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
