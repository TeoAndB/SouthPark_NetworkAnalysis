They invite [[Randy Marsh]], a cock magician going by the stage name of the Amazingly Randy, to perform for the children. When the performance starts, the parents return to the kitchen to prepare the cake. Unbeknownst to them, Randy's cock magic tricks are performed with his penis. One of the tricks involves putting his penis into a magic box and sawing through it. The trick goes wrong and he cuts his penis off, spurting blood. The parents mistake the kindergartners' screams of horror for being excited by the show. Randy tells this kindergartner girl to reach behind her ear, as his penis had fallen there and is still wiggling. She hands it to him, utterly horrified.\n\nIt is then that her parents see what has happened and call the police. However, [[Harrison Yates]] accuses them of making a false cock magic report because he believes that cock magic is the card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering (CCG)]]''. He then arrests the girl's mother who was the one who called the police. The girl looks on, screaming and crying in her father's arms.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe kindergartner girl has dark brown pigtails with bangs tied with green ribbons.
