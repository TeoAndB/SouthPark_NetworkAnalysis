He makes a cameo in the movie appearing on the [[Asses of Fire]] poster. He later appears in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\" and in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", where he was seen as a \"giant dick\".\n\n==Background==\nScott is a resident of Ontario, [[Canada]], and is the nemesis of Terrance and Phillip and notorious among his fellow Canadians. He is most well known for being \"a dick\" and driving a PT Cruiser. (Often, when he made his entrances to the scenes in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", the other Canadians in the same scene would shout out to the boys: \"Oh no! It's Scott! He's a ''dick''!\", or some variation thereof.) He is uptight and short-tempered, especially when it comes to Terrance and Phillip's toilet humor. Despite all of this, he claims he is the most patriotic Canadian.\n\n===Occupation===\nIn the Season Two episode, \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\", he was the duo's prosecutor in court and was made [[Saddam Hussein]]'s adviser later in episode. He was Saddam's adviser again in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\", while Saddam was in disguise as Canada's new Prime Minister. However, it was stated by Scott that his official job is a journalist, i.e. a television critic for magazines.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has brown, spiky hair. He wears dark blue jeans and a brown, long-sleeved shirt with a black capital \"S\" embroidered in the middle. In several of Scott's appearances, he wears a red tie with his shirt. Like most Canadian characters, he has a Pac-Man head.\n\nIn \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", as a result of radiation poisoning in Ottawa, he appears as a giant, which causes fellow Canadians to refer to him as a \"giant dick\" (despite the fact he is actually slightly taller than he used to be), he also wears a red tie during the episode.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Scott the Dick\">\nTerrancePhillipInNotWithoutMyAnus16.png|Scott The Dick talking to [[Terrance and Phillip]] on the phone in \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\".\nReturn Of Scott The Dick.png|Scott in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe appears to be quite xenophobic and racist, stating that Americans are \"power-hungry\" and was going to send the boys away, in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\". He also dislikes [[Inuit]] people, but seems desperate to deny that he is an \"Eskimo racist\". In general, Scott just seems to dislike everybody.\n\n==Prominence==\n[[File:Scott_talking_about_eskimos.jpg|thumb|Scott with [[Ugly Bob]] in \"[[Royal Pudding]]\".]]\n*\"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\"\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (seen on the ''Asses of Fire'' poster)\n*\"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\"\n*\"[[Royal Pudding]]\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[es:Scott]]\n[[ja:チンポ野郎スコット]]\n[[zh:混蛋斯科特]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
