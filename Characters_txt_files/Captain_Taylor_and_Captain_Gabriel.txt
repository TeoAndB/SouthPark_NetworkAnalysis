While Captain Taylor isn't seen, it can be assumed that he is the one flying the plane.\n\nIn the second part of the duology, \"[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]\", they play a somewhat larger role. They are seen waiting with The Boys for a fueling tank to come meet them to give them gas for the plane, but the fueling tank never shows up. They and The Boys are then forced to find another way out of Peru and they come across a jungle area with giant fruit (dubbed \"Land of the Giants Lost World\" by [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]). They come across a large honeycomb-like structure and are both killed by a grub-like creature.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey both wear gray pilot helmets with mouthpieces connected to them as well as gray outfits with the American flag on the left shoulders and black shoes.\n\nCaptain Taylor has combed blonde hair, blonde eyebrows, and a blonde mustache. Captain Gabriel has combed brown hair and brown eyebrows.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Captain Taylor and Captain Gabriel\">\nCaptain-Gabriel-Pandemic.png|Captain Gabriel telling The Boys the plan in \"[[Pandemic]]\"\nSPPII1.jpg|Taylor and Gabriel waiting with The Boys and Craig\nTaylor-and-Gabriel-no-Helmets.png|Taylor and Gabriel without their helmets\nTaylor-and-Gabriel-Death.png|Taylor and Gabriel's deaths\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[fr:Captain Taylor and Captain Gabriel]]\n[[zh:泰勒上尉和加百利上尉]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]"
