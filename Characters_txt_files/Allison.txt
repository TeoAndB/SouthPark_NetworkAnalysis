"{{South Park character\n|image = Allison.png\n|name = Allison\n|gender = Female\n|race = Caucasian\n|hair = Brown\n|voice = [[Mona Marshall]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0983727/|title=\"South Park\" D-Yikes! (TV episode 2007)|publisher=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[D-Yikes!]]\"\n}}\n'''Allison''' appears in the [[Season Eleven]] episode, \"[[D-Yikes!]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAllison meets [[Mrs. Garrison]] at a gym. After overhearing Garrison bad-mouthing men, she assumed that she's a lesbian and asks her to join her at the local girl bar [[Les Bos]]. After realizing that it's a lesbian bar, Mrs. Garrison freaks out, until calmed by Allison. After sharing a kiss, they spend the rest of the night having sex. Allison then joins Mrs. Garrison's crusade to protect Les Bos from rival [[Xerxes]] who wants to take over the bar.\n\n==Appearance==\nAllison has long, brown hair, wrinkles near her lip and chin, and tired eyes. She wears a pink, button-up shirt brown pants, and green earrings.\n\n==Personality==\nShe appears to be unintelligent, mistaking [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]'s rantings about men as a confirmation of sexuality. Judging by her choice of Mrs. Garrison as a sexual partner, we can assume she likes \"butch\" women.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]]===\nShe dated Mrs. Garrison in \"[[D-Yikes!]]\". Mrs. Garrison has since changed back into a man, so we can only assume their relationship is over.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A [[Mrs. Trumski|woman]] who looks extremely similar to Allison appears in \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\". The woman is the mother of [[Vernon Trumski]], the boy who had [[Lemmiwinks]]. The woman has the same body shape as Allison, and similar facial features.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n[[es:Allison]]\n[[fr:Allison]]\n[[zh:艾莉森]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Mona Marshall]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
