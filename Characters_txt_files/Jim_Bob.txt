Jim Bob, like [[Darryl Weathers|Darryl]], was hypocritically unhappy with Alexa's job once he had actually taken it, and snapped at Cartman when he tried to play a game of ''Simon Says'' with him, finding his requests to be abhorrent.\n\n==Appearance==\nJim Bob is overweight, so much so that his belly is coming out of his shirt. He has dark gray hair with sideburns and pink cheeks. He was seen wearing a black shirt, gray pants, and black shoes. Jim Bob's mouth is uniquely designed when he is not speaking.\n\n==Personality==\nJim Bob lacks Alexa's subservience, much to Cartman's dismay.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-One}}\n[[es:Jim Bob]]\n[[uk:Джим Боб]]\n[[zh:吉姆·鲍勃]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Poor characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]"
