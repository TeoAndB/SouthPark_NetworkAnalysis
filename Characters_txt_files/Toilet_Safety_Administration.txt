The TSA appears in the [[Season Sixteen]] episode, \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", where they were seen providing excessive security wherever there was a toilet.\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] fails to put the toilet seat down, his [[Betsy Donovan|mother]] dies, causing the government to step in and provide the TSA at every toilet, gradually increasing security and prominence throughout the episode. Initially, the TSA's only purpose was to install safety belts on toilets, but eventually, they started handing out citations for not wearing the belts, and provided airport-like security at all toilets, public and private.\n\nThe TSA installed cameras in all private toilets, which were monitored remotely and discreetly by a single individual. This individual was overweight and took advantage of the fact that he got aroused by watching everybody use the toilet. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] defied the cameras by bringing a gun, a baby, and a hostage past the TSA checkpoint in his restroom, while leaving the toilet seat up.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe typical attire of a TSA agent consists of dark gray work pants, a blue long sleeved shirt, a white name tag, a gold TSA badge, and a black tie. Some TSA agents wear jewelry and excessive amounts of make up.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Toilet Safety Administration\">\nReverseCowgirl040.png|The TSA \"frisking\" on a woman.\nReverseCowgirl055.png|The TSA providing security in [[Randy Marsh]]'s restroom.\nReverseCowgirl065.png|A TSA agent remotely monitoring every toilet in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n</gallery>\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Sixteen}}\n[[zh:马桶安全局]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Police officers]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]"
