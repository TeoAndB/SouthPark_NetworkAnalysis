When all of the pan flute bands were sent to internment camps by the US government the guineas went on a rampage. They destroyed [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] and killed many people, and everyone was terrified of them. [[Randy Marsh]] wanted to film them to get good footage of the family, and [[Sharon Marsh]] was put off and was demanding him to turn off the camera.\n\n==Personality==\nThe guinea creatures are shown to be able to reach a higher level of intelligence, even sentience, as the Guinea Pirate does. The Guinea creatures can also morph into other creatures, such as how the Guinea Pirate morphs into a human and infiltrates the American Government.\nGuinea Creatures can possibly overcome their weakness of Peruvian flute bands if they are smart enough, as the Guinea Pirate does. He is the only known Guinea Creature to successfully leave The Guinea Creatures Home and live in a place where Peruvian flute bands were.\n\n==Types of Guinea Creatures==\nThere were many guinea creatures shown and mentioned in the episode, \"[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]\", including:\n*Giant guinea pigs\n*Guinea bees\n*Guinea rabbits\n*Guinea spiders (mentioned only)\n*Guinea rats\n*Guinea bears (mentioned only)\n*Guinea panthers (mentioned only)\n*Guinea-saurus rex\n*[[Michael Chertoff|Guinea pirate]]\n*Guinea prisoner. As the guinea prisoner was actually the guinea pirate, this makes them one and the same.\n\nAs for the guinea pigs, their only weakness were the Peruvian flute bands, which the government got rid of. The Peruvian flute bands then came back and got rid of the guinea creatures.\n\n[[Craig Tucker]] was the only citizen from [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] that could destroy the guinea creatures, as shown on a wall that [[The Boys]] saw in Peru.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Images of the Guinea Creatures\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"160\">\nguinea creatures 27.png\nguinea creatures 28.png\nguinea creatures 30.png\nguinea creatures 16.png\nguinea creatures 3.png\nguinea creatures 4.png\nguinea creatures 5.png\nguinea creatures 19.png|Ancient Incan drawings of Peruvian pan flute bands driving away guinea pigs\nguinea creatures 17.png|Guinea pigs drawings on ancient Incan wall\nguinea creatures 18.png|[[Craig Tucker]] portrayed on ancient Incan wall fighting against guinea pig\nCartoon GP.png|''\"Guinea pirate!\"''\nguinea creatures 6.png|[[Michael Chertoff|guinea pirate]]\nguinea creatures 26.png|Guinea pirate being escorted into prison\nguinea creatures 2.png|Guinea prisoner\nguinea creatures 13.png|Nests of guinea pigs in [[Peru]]\nguinea creatures 1.png|Guinea bees' hive\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Guinea pigs are raised and eaten in Peru and other countries within South America as a cheap source of meat.\n*The creators found a website dedicated to selling guinea pig costumes so the 'creatures' seen in the show were only possible from those costumes available from the site.\n*In the commentary Matt and Trey expressed difficulty filming the live action guinea pigs in costume as guinea pigs have a defense mechanism where they will freeze their whole body and move little to none.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n[[zh:巨型豚鼠族]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Realistic characters]]"
