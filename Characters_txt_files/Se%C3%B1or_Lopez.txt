He then daydreams about himself living in a world of minorities and one of them involves talking to Señor Lopez. Cartman tells him that he does just as much work as a minority, but Lopez says that he won't make nearly as much as a minority.\n\n==Appearance==\nSeñor Lopez has combed black hair, black eyebrows, and a large bushy black mustache. He wears a black business suit with a white undershirt and a black tie, black pants, and black shoes. He is seen holding a cigar and is only ever shown with his legs on his desk.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Señor Lopez's character model has been used for background characters in several other episodes, such as one of the Mexicans in \"[[D-Yikes!]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[zh:洛佩兹先生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Hispanic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
