He was very large in stature and made his only appearance in \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", where he is the main antagonist.\n\n==Background==\nHe challenged the real Stan Marsh to a game of Yahtzee. Stan won and his Facebook profile was defeated and vanished. Stan was sent back to the real world, now having zero friends because his profile \"died\". All of his friends were sent to [[Kip Drordy]]'s profile, who had no friends at that time.\n\n==Appearance==\nProfile Stan Marsh's appearance was similar to Stan in terms of his body and shape. He was physically taller than Stan, being almost five times his size. Profile Stan Marsh wore a black and red Tron suit which includes gloves, a helmet, shoulder pads, pants, and a shirt.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Profile Stan Marsh\">>\nYouHave0Friends095.png|Profile Stan Marsh answers Stan's call.\nYouHave0Friends102.png|Stan confronting his profile.\nYouHave0Friends103.png\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n[[es:Perfil de Stan Marsh]]\n[[zh:斯坦的个人资料]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
