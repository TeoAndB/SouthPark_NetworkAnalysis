He is a very muscular man and a stereotypical over-protective father, making sure his daughter doesn't get into any trouble. Three different versions of Mr. Turner were shown in \"[[Probably]]\", \"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\", and \"[[Marjorine]]\". These errors were likely the result of Heidi's character model not being finalized, due to her status as a background character.\n\n==Background==\n===\"[[Probably]]\"===\nHeidi's original father was shown in \"[[Probably]]\", attempting to take her out of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s cult. He was killed after a piece of wood fell on him.\n\n===\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\"===\nA second version of Heidi's father appeared in \"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\", where he was seen hiding with [[Nancy Turner|his wife]], [[Heidi Turner|his daughter]], and, presumably, [[Boy with Blond Hair|his son]].\n\n===\"[[Marjorine]]\"===\nThe third and current model of Heidi's father first appeared in \"[[Marjorine]]\", where he was watching over the girls at [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]]'s slumber party making sure that there were no boys at the party. He looked out the window in one scene with binoculars looking straight into [[Craig Tucker]]'s Binoculars. He then yelled: \"Ahaa! I knew it! Boys at the slumber party!\" [[Butters Stotch]], hearing this, presumed he was talking about him, and took the \"future telling device\" and ran away.\n\nHe also makes small cameos in \"[[200]]\" and \"[[201]]\" during crowd scenes. He also appeared in \"[[Jewpacabra]]\", where he was seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Turner has short, blond hair with two bangs hanging down in front. He has a blond mustache similar to that of [[Randy Marsh]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s father. He wears a green t-shirt and black pants. Mr. Turner is also very muscular.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Marjorine]]\"- First speaking role.
