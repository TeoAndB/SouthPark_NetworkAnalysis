However, Cartman is forced to allow other people into the park, on top of expenses required to maintain the park itself, eventually seeing many more attendees per day than it could in the past. This made its way to a HBC television program known as ''Money Quest'', where its hosts praise Cartman for turning the fortunes of the theme park, calling Cartman the \"financial genius of our time\" and reporting that there are other businesses attempting to adopt similar tactics.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] who is suffering from hemorrhoid in response to Cartman's one million dollar inheritance, passes out upon watching the program.\n\n==Appearance==\nOne of the hosts is overweight and has balding brown hair with beard.
