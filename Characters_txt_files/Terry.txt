He confronts his wife about this information, who claims she was being sarcastic and was angry that he never went with her to therapy. Later, Terry meets with his older friend, Rick, to talk about why his wife queefed on his face. Rick states that the reason has something to do with his new job as Canadian Minister of Health. Terry then calls everyone in the Canadian healthcare system, asking them if they're satisfied; this eventually leads him to call [[Kyle Broflovski]] about his little brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], and later realizing that Ike had been receiving the wrong medication for several months. After having been very defensive about the Canadian healthcare system, he realizes that his hostile defensiveness of the flawed system has been the reason for why his wife queefed in his face. He then makes up with his wife.\n\n==Appearance==\nLike the other Canadians, Terry has beady eyes and a Pac-Man-like head that flaps up and down. He has blond hair, a blond, split mustache and wears a black business suit consisting of a black coat, gray dress shirt, a red and white striped tie, brown pants, and black shoes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n[[zh:泰瑞（加拿大健康部部长）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
