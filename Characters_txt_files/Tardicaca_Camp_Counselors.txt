They first appear in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, \"[[Crippled Summer]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe counselors run the camp throughout the episode. The campers compete in competitions divided into a red and blue team. The events include: swimming, archery, scavenger hunt, 50-yard dash, three legged race, bear hunting, basketball, surfing, canoeing, and a talent show. [[Steve]] is the leader of the camp counselors.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey are of varying appearances but all wear the Lake Tardicaca camp t-shirt and shorts.\n\n==''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''==\nThe counselors became a fairly important plot point in ''[[Bring the Crunch]]'', where they are essential to keep the Camp at Lake Tardicaca alive. Knowing this, in an attempt to destroy the camp, [[Nathan]] decided to let [[Mimsy]] tie them up and to hire thugs to scare children away.\n\nHowever, Mimsy mistook Nathan's command as an assassination order, and started murdering counselors. [[Fastpass]], [[Professor Chaos (Character)|Professor Chaos]], [[Mintberry Crunch]] are determined to stop this and save the camp. One of the counselors committed suicide after he realized he subjected children to penile imagery, and two counselors were gravely injured before their painful demise. \n\nFinally, the last female counselor survived the murder and the alien abduction, and proceed to get ready for the camp.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Crippled Summer]]\" - They manage the camp activities at Lake Tardicaca.\n*\"[[Handicar]]\" - They go over the funds raised for summer camp with the campers.\n*\"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\" - Just one of the counselors appears.\n*\"[[Moss Piglets]]\" - Only [[Steve]] teaches Special Ed and prepares the Science Fair with the students.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n[[zh:塔蒂喀喀夏令营辅导员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Former school faculty]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]"
