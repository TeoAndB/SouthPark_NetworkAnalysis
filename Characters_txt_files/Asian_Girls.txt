They were formally introduced in the [[Season Nineteen]] episode, \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", but a few of them are also seen in \"[[Safe Space]]\". They have since become background characters.\n\nThere are other Asian-American female students at the school, such as [[Liza Nelson]], who are not considered part of his clique.\n\n==Background==\nThe Asian Girls are a specific clique consisting of several girls with at least Japanese, Korean, and Chinese heritage, including \nLisa Akimoto, Kelly Zhou and Heather Nishimura. They tend to be quiet and keep to themselves, responding to outside events through their art rather than direct action, and sometimes conversing in their native dialects. They all appear to be artists. Many of them also sell their works to others behind [[Whole Foods]] in [[CtPaTown]].\n\nDuring \"[[Tweek x Craig]]\", the Asian Girls draw pictures of [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] together in a fictitious homosexual relationship, starting a rumor that the two are dating. [[Wendy Testaburger]] holds a presentation for the school featuring their art, drawing much attention to them and the rumor, and they are also seen selling their art in CtPaTown. When Tweek and Craig \"break up,\" The Asian girls draw more depressed art to reflect the way the town feels.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Safe Space]]\" - A few of them can be seen on the bleachers.\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" - The group draws yaoi pictures of Tweek and Craig, spawning the rumor that they are in a relationship.
