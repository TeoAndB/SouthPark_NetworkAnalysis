He first appears in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\".\n\n==Background==\nKevin is often seen as Dr. Mephesto's silent, but faithful lab assistant. In \"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\", he helps Mephesto breed a pot-belly pig and an elephant. In \"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\", [[Chef]] is inspiring the town to help solve the turkey crisis, when he asks Mephesto what Kevin is, who replies by saying that it wasn't an important matter.\n\nDuring \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" and \"[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]\", Kevin's name is revealed, and he assists Dr. Mephesto in finding out who Cartman's real father is. In \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\", when announcing the potential candidates for Cartman's father, the cliffhanger narrator refers to him as \"that little monkey guy who follows Dr. Mephesto around\".\n\nHe later reappears in subsequent episodes, usually alongside Dr. Mephesto. Until \"[[201]]\", where he screams in distress, Kevin was entirely silent.\n\n===''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''===\nKevin's story is told in the song \"[[Mephesto and Kevin]]\" by Primus from Chef Aid: The South Park Album. He was apparently a failed attempt to create a perfect pop singer, a test tube baby created from [[Michael Jackson]]'s sperm and the egg of an unspecified, musically talented female donor, brought to term inside the womb of a llama. It is also revealed Kevin is legally Dr. Mephesto's son.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Kevin1.png|thumb|Kevin in \"[[201]]\"]]\nKevin looks similar to Dr. Mephesto in that he wears black shoes, brown pants, and a yellow floral-pattern shirt. He has black hair, similar to Fosse McDonald, and whiskers. He is often described as a gopher-boy. Kevin's appearance has been adjusted and cleaned in his appearance on \"[[201]]\" but he seems to have returned to his former appearance in \"[[Bike Parade]]\".{{GallerySubPage|name=Kevin Mephesto}}\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto.\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - Asked about by [[Chef]].\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto; also a prospective father of [[Eric Cartman]].\n*\"[[Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto.\n*\"[[Prehistoric Ice Man]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto unfreeze [[Larry (\"Prehistoric Ice Man\")|Larry]].\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' -\n*\"[[Spontaneous Combustion]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto bring to light [[Randy Marsh]]'s false science.\n*\"[[Jakovasaurs]]\" - Seen helping Dr. Mephesto learn about [[Jakovasaur|Jakov]].\n*\"[[Are You There God?
