He is recommended by [[Stephen Stotch]] to request help in giving [[Eric Cartman]] a vaccination. He was called because Cartman acts like a hog, becomes out of control, and squeals whenever he sees an injection while running naked like a hog to avoid getting a shot.\n\n==Appearance==\nBig Mesquite Murph has black combed hair on his top, while the rest of his head is shaved along with black eyelashes. He has a beard and wears green overalls equipped with a large knife, yellow rope, yellow gloves, and wears black messy boots. He has chest hair and hair on his arms and shoulders.
