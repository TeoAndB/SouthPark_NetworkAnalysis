He wore a mask constantly; however, at the end of \"[[The Jeffersons]]\", his father lets him take off. He reveals that he is a test-tube baby and never knew his mother.\n\n==Appearance==\nBlanket is wearing a small black tuxedo, a gray shirt, a yellow vest, black pants, and spats. He also dons a mask or veil up until the last few minutes of \"[[The Jeffersons]]\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Blanket Jackson\">\nBlanket.png|Blanket without the mask.\nBlanket-kenny.png|[[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] dressed as Blanket.\nSp 0807 01 v6.jpg|Blanket wearing his mask in \"[[The Jeffersons]]\".\nJefferson (4).png|Blanket and the [[The Boys|boys]] with [[Michael Jackson|Michael]].\nTheJeffersons03.jpg|Blanket with [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]].\nTheJeffersons11.jpg|Blanket with Michael.\nJefferson (15).png|Blanket with Michael at his window.\nJefferson (17).png|Michael playing \"got your nose\" with Blanket.\nJefferson (20).png|Michael chasing [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], Kyle, and Blanket.\nJefferson (24).png|Blanket reconciling with Michael.\nJefferson (21).png|Michael singing with most of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]]'s populace, including Blanket.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nIn contrast to [[the boys]], Blanket is an average boy. He appears to be more mature than his father, who wants to pretend to be a child, and Blanket wants a regular father/son relationship instead.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Blanket is clearly based on Michael Jackson's real son Prince Michael Jackson II, although he is more Caucasian than he is in real life.\n*Blanket legally changed his name to Bigi to avoid being harassed at school.\n*The real Blanket Jackson was 2 years old when \"[[The Jeffersons]]\" aired. Blanket (now known as Bigi), is currently {{age|2002|2|21}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eight}}\n[[es:Blanket Jackson]]\n[[fr:Blanket Jackson]]\n[[ja:ブランケット・ジャクソン]]\n[[zh:毯毯·杰克逊]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:1st graders]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]"
