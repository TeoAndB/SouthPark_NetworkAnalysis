The mime tells the group that the Prime Minister had recently passed a law that banned the consumption of wine, and wanted to follow them.\n\nThe group managed to overturn the laws when it was discovered that [[Saddam Hussein]] had been in control all along.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe mime wears a typical mime costume. Unlike most Canadians, the mime has a square-shaped head instead of a round one.\n\n==Personality==\nIt is noted by Rick the Mountie that the mime, like all other French Canadians, are \"a little odd\". In the first conversations, the mime would show a hand sign imitating calling the other party through a phone, and expects them to reciprocate.\n\nThe mime rarely uses body movements and instead speaks often, which is atypical of a mime artist.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seven}}\n[[zh:哑剧演员]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
