In episodes, they are used as a device to reference the [[Wikipedia: Generation Snowflake|Snowflake Generation]]; young adults who are very politically correct and offended easily.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe PC Babies are quintuplets (three boys and two girls) with dirty blonde hair. They all wear Oakley sunglasses with polarized lenses similar to their father.\n\n==Personality==\nAs their name suggests, the PC Babies have inherited their father's political correctness, albeit to a much greater degree. They have a tendency to cry at anything even slightly offensive, or sometimes for no reason at all.\n\nThey are quite intelligent for their age, since they are currently able to walk and say a few words.\n\n==Trivia==\n*During \"[[Buddha Box]]\" the group has a[[PC Babies (Song)| mock intro sequence]] that parodies the 2018 ''[[Wikipedia:Muppet Babies (2018 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'' opening sequence, which is given the idea of a new intro replacing the Tegridy Farms opening used in the first six episodes of [[Season Twenty-Three]].\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Problem with a Poo]]\" - Strong Woman struggles to look after them on her own and refuses to allow PC Principal to act as a father figure to them.\n*\"[[Buddha Box]]\" - Both parents fall out while the babies protest on their own. Ultimately all become much more of a family albeit in secret.\n*\"[[Bike Parade]]\" - One of their songs is heard on the radio. They are later seen at the bike parade with their parents.\n*\"[[Band in China]]\" (mentioned only) - Have become a band and got their biopic which made over 100 million USD.\n*\"[[Board Girls]]\" - Get upset by gender stereotypes on TV and later hugs PC Principal knowing they grown up.\n*\"[[Basic Cable]]\" - Their show appears during the random streaming series scene.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of PC Babies\">\nSPPWP - 00215.png|The babies soon after birth.\nSPPWP - 00227.png|Initially, the parents struggle with their roles when in public.\nBuddhaBox33.png|PC Babies cry over the two genders bathroom.\nBuddhaBox70.png|Strong Woman and PC Principal leave [[South Park Elementary]] with their children.\nBoardGirls25.png|The babies watch their father confronting [[Heather Swanson]] in \"[[Board Girls]]\".\nBoardGirls75.png|The PC Babies with their parents at the end of \"[[Board Girls]]\".\n</gallery>\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-Two}}\n[[es:Bebés PC]]\n[[ja:PCベビー]]\n[[zh:政确宝宝]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Siblings]]"
