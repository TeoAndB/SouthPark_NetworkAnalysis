They are responsible for creating a massive conspiracy to get men blowjobs through subliminal messaging in Broadway theater productions.\n\nThey all appear in the episode \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\". When they learn about [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s new play, ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen'', they are alarmed that the overtness of the play will disclose the secret of Broadway and set out to stop him.\n\nAlthough their first meeting is confrontational, Randy and Sondheim later have a \"bro-down\" and gain respect for one another. Now officially \"bros\", the other writers eagerly help Randy make his play more subtle, renaming it to ''[[The Woman in White]]'' and removing all the outright mentions of blowjobs, instead of introducing more oral \"subtext\". It is not known whether the play was completed, as Randy left to interrupt a performance of ''Wicked'' in order to stop [[Shelly Marsh|his daughter]] from performing oral sex on [[Larry Feegan|her boyfriend]] before it was completed.\n\n==Stephen Sondheim==\n[[File:Stephen Sondheim.png|200px|thumb|Stephen Sondheim as he appeared in \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\".]]\n'''Stephen Sondheim''' has written a large number of critically acclaimed theater productions, including (but not limited to) ''West Side Story'', ''Sweeney Todd'', ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Merrily We Roll Along''. Sondheim was described as \"the greatest Broadway composer alive today, perhaps the greatest of all time\" during the episode. He has a \"bro-down\" with [[Randy Marsh]], after which they become bros. He later helps Randy introduce some subtext into his play, ''The Woman in White''. He wears a black, yellow, and white Pittsburgh Steelers jersey as well as a Steelers' hat of the same colors.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Stephen Schwartz==\n[[File:Stephen Schwartz.png|200px|thumb|Stephen Schwartz as he appeared in \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\".]]\n'''Stephen Schwartz''' wrote the critically acclaimed theater musicals ''Godspell'' and ''Wicked'' (among others), the latter of which Randy and [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]], and later [[Shelly Marsh|Shelly]] and [[Larry Feegan|Larry]], go to see during the episode. He wears a black T-shirt with \"Chick Seat\" and an upwards arrow printed in red at its center.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Andrew Lloyd Webber==\n[[File:Andrew Lloyd Webber.png|200px|thumb|Andrew Lloyd Webber as he appeared in \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\".]]\n'''Andrew Lloyd Webber''' wrote the Broadway hits ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Cats''. After they become bros, Webber helps Randy write some subtext into his play, ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen''. It is Webber who suggests that the play be renamed to the much more subtle title ''The Woman in White''. He wears a purple hoodie.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Elton John==\n[[File:Broad_Elton_John.png|200px|thumb|Elton John as he appeared in \"[[Broadway Bro Down]]\".]]\n{{Main|Elton John}}\n'''Elton John''' has composed the score for several successful Broadway productions, including ''Lestat: The Musical'' and ''The Lion King''. Elton John previously appeared on the show in the episode \"[[Chef Aid]]\" and on the accompanying [[Chef Aid: Behind the Menu|mockumentary]] and [[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|album]]. He wore a red, long-sleeve jersey and red-lensed, black-framed sunglasses.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n[[fr:Broadway Bros]]\n[[ja:ブロードウェイ・ブラザーズ]]\n[[zh:百老汇兄弟]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]"
