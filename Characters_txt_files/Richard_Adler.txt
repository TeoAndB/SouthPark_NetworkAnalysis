He first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\". \n\nHe often admonishes students to stop \"screwing around\" for various reasons, and plays small supporting or background roles in scenes where school faculty are needed.\n\n==Background==\nMr. Adler is first introduced in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" when the boys take shop class. He asks which of the kids in class is a troublemaker, which prompts the boys to argue whether it is [[Tweek Tweak]] or [[Craig Tucker]]. Throughout the episode, he is played by recurring memories of his deceased [[Mr. Adler's Girlfriend|fiancée]], which culminates in a vision of her death, followed by the consumption of nicotine gum. He is dating [[Pearl]], the home economics teacher, but has trouble moving on from his deceased fiancee. He plans to commit suicide after running out of his supply of gum, and after writing his suicide note, Adler planned to commit suicide by laying on a log cutter. However, he is interrupted by a fight between Tweek and Craig, who enter his classroom through the window, killing [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in the process. After having a vision including his fiancée, his grandmother, and his uncle, he is finally able to move on.\n\nHe returns in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]\", where he speaks at a meeting to agree with [[Diane Choksondik]] that the teachers have a responsibility to keep the school children, including [[Kindergartners]] safe if they will \"screw around\" anyway.\n\nIn \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\", he is present as the adults discuss the confusion over the September 11th terrorist attacks, to which he agrees with [[Skeeter]] that it was a conspiracy and asks if others are aware there were explosions seen at the base of the towers.\n\nHe voted for [[Barack Obama]] in \"[[About Last Night...]]\" and wore a grey sweater with Obama's face as well, expressing optimism that everything would be awesome.\n\nIn \"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" he appeared alongside [[Mr. Mackey]] as one of the commentators at the basketball game. \n\nIn \"[[Mysterion Rises]]\", it is revealed that Adler is a member of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] when the boys recognize him attending one of the cult meetings at Jim McElroy's House. He can also be seen in a photograph being arrested as a member of the cult ten years prior to the series alongside [[Stuart McCormick]] and [[Carol McCormick|his wife]].\n\nHe played a prominent role with the [[Principal Victoria]] and Mackey in \"[[Bass to Mouth]]\" as they tried to avoid another student suicide and work with [[Eric Cartman]] to prevent him from teasing the victims of Eavesdropper, leading to them throwing him under a bus.\n\nIn \"[[Butterballs]]\", he is confused when he finds [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Grandma Stotch|his grandmother]] in a school bathroom that isn't supposed to be locked, before offering to help her find the correct girls' bathroom, laughing off her excuse that Butters had allegedly showed her to the wrong room.\n\nHe is shown sitting at a bar with [[Herbert Garrison]] and [[Jimbo Kern]] when Garrison expresses concern about political correctness and immigration in \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\", leading to Garrison's presidential campaign, though he is not seen attending any campaign events.\n\nIn \"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\", he is one of the adults trying to get the [[COVID-19 Vaccine]] at [[Walgreens]], seen at the beginning with [[Mr. Mackey]].\n\n==Appearance==\nAdler is overweight with balding brown hair and has sagging, overly large cheeks. He wears a white long-sleeved shirt, under a green vest, and beige pants. His vest has a diamond-shaped, green and black pattern on it. He also has a band-aid on his head from an unknown injury which he has in all of his appearances.\n\nWhen he ten years younger, he looked similarly, with slightly more hair behind his ears, darker, no bandaid on his head, and a similar sweater but a deeper shade of blue and a slightly different pattern. This design is occasionally used incorrectly in the background of present-day appearances.\n\nIn the future timeline set in ''[[South Park: Post Covid]]'', he wears a white short-sleeved shirt, while retaining the green vest. The diamond patterns on his vest has lined up to form a continuous horizontal band. His nose has slightly reddened.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Richard Adler\">\nTweekvsCraig002.png|Teaching shop class.\nTweekvsCraig004.png|At his desk in the shop classroom.\nTweekvsCraig015.png|Reminiscing about his fiancee.\nTweekvsCraig029.png|After a date with Pearl.\nTweekvsCraig058.png|Struggling to sleep.\nTweekvsCraig072.png|Attempting suicide.\nTweekvsCraig083.png|Embracing Kenny's corpse in grief.\nProperCondomUse013.png|At a PTA meeting in \"[[Proper Condom Use]]]\".\nMysteryoftheUrinalDeuce053.png|Discussing 911 in \"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\".\nElementarySchoolMusical073.png|Sports commentator at a basketball game.\nAboutLastNight007.png|Celebrating Barack Obama.\nMysterionRisesArrests.png|Arrested in his youth alongside Kenny's folks.\nMysterionRisesAdler.png|Attending a Cult of Cthulhu meeting.\nWhereMyCountryGone004.png|Getting drinks with Jimbo and Garrison.\nSkankHunt00001.png|Incorrect design at PTA meeting.\nShots024.png|Incorrect design at PTA meeting.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nMr. Adler seems to generally be a relaxed person who is not particularly outspoken. When something makes him feel anxious or guilty, he appears easily overwhelmed, taking a while to move past his fiancee's death and becoming suicidal when he runs out of nicotine gum to deal with it.\n\nHe claims to have a low tolerance for troublemakers, asking students to identify themselves or classmates as such, and often expresses concern that students are \"screwing around\", referring to causing trouble, fighting, not paying attention, or on one occasion, sex itself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Adler is based on an old shop teacher who taught co-creator [[Matt Stone]].\n*He is the only recurring school faculty member played by Matt, as [[Trey Parker]] voices Mr. Garrison, Mr. Mackey, [[PC Principal]] and others, so he is often Matt's only chance to provide a voice in scenes where he appears. This is why he is almost always accompanied with Mackey in particular, as this allows Trey and Matt to record together, though he does speak to [[Butters Stotch]] on two occasions.\n*Even though he is only the shop teacher, he is very often seen accompanying Mackey or [[Principal Victoria]] at meetings and assemblies where other teachers are not present, which would suggest he has a position in the school administration, though this is never stated.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\" - Teaches shop class, and can't get over the death of his fiancée.\n*\"[[Proper Condom Use]]\" - Agrees with [[Ms. Choksondik]] where they should teach Sexual education to kindergarteners.\n*\"[[How to Eat with Your Butt]]\" - Seen watching the school children get their pictures taken.\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[Erection Day]]\"- Briefly seen in [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]]'s nightmare.\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" - Seen at the school standing in the crowd of students and teachers looking at the television.\n*\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\" - Talks at the town hall meeting.\n*\"[[Tonsil Trouble]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[About Last Night...]]\" - States his support for Barack Obama.\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[Pinewood Derby]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\" - Compliments [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] on his novel.\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen at the town's meeting.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Seen in the crowd giving Santa in bear costume to gingers.\n*\"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" - (cameo)\n*\"[[Mysterion Rises]]\" - Shown as a member of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]].\n*\"[[Bass to Mouth]]\" - Appears with [[Mr. Mackey]] and [[Principal Victoria]] in attempting to prevent further suicides occurring at the school.

If they take too long taking the photograph or shake the camera, he may reject the selfie for \"screwing around\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{South Park Elementary Staff}}\n[[de:Richard Adler]]\n[[es:Richard Adler]]\n[[it:Richard Adler]]\n[[ja:リチャード・アドラー]]\n[[ru:Ричард Адлер]]\n[[zh:理查德·阿德勒]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Matt Stone]]\n[[Category:School faculty]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Cthulhu cult followers]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
