[[The Boys]] found him brooding in a bar near the Wall-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. He told the boys that the only way to kill a Wall-Mart was to destroy its heart (a glass mirror near the television department). His guilt got the best of him, and he then committed suicide, asking the boys to tell the world that he was sorry. Thanks to his help, [[Randy Marsh|Randy]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] were able to destroy the Wall-Mart in South Park.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has graying brown hair, and bags under his eyes, presumably from the guilt of opening [[Wall-Mart]]. He wore a white, button-up undershirt, brown coat, a messily put on brown tie, and brown pants.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Harvey Brown\">\n809 23.jpg|Harvey, feeling remorseful about creating Wall-Mart.\n809 24.jpg|\"It isn't gonna stop till there's nothing but Wall-Mart left!\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nIn \"[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]\", he was incredibly remorseful and guilty over establishing a one-stop super store like Wall-Mart in 1987, only for it to go out of control and form a mind of its own in four years, becoming extremely depressed and eventually shooting himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*A man with a similar appearance can be seen sitting outside [[Tom's Rhinoplasty (Location)|Tom's Rhinoplasty]] during [[The Bowels of the Beast]] mission in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[pl:Harvey Brown]]\n[[zh:哈维·布朗]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
