He was later seen among the dead celebrities that were held back on board a purgatory plane when [[Michael Jackson]] refused to accept his death. After Michael Jackson had done so, the passengers were flown to [[Hell]], and expressed their dismay when they found that Hell was a tow-in gate.\n\nCarradine was mentioned in \"[[Sexual Healing]]\", when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] are warned that if they continue on their path of \"sex addiction\", they may end up dead from auto-erotic asphyxiation just like Carradine. This ends up true for Kenny.\n\n==Appearance==\nDavid Carradine has long gray hair. He was seen wearing only the bottom half of a black bondage suit, with a noose tied to his neck. His appearance in the episode is a reference to his real life death as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Thirteen}}\n[[zh:大卫·卡拉丁]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
