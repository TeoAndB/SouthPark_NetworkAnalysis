He personally seeks to eliminate [[Craig Tucker|Craig]].\n\nHe reappears in the continuation \"[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]\" where he personally confronts the boys and reveals his true form as the Guinea Pirate, leader of the Furry Death. However, Craig defeats him with his superpowers completely by accident, and he is replaced. However, at the end of the episode, he somehow escapes from jail and wreaks havoc once again, but this situation remains unresolved by the end of the episode.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn human form, he looks like the real-life Michael Chertoff, almost bald and dressed in a dark suit with a red tie. In his true form, he looks like a guinea pig in a pirate costume. He later appears as a guinea pirate in a jail outfit after he escapes from prison.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Michael Chertoff\" spacing=\"small\">\nSPW pic -- Pandemic P117.jpg|Chertoff holds a picture of [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] in \"[[Pandemic]]\"\nPic30.jpg|The Guinea Pirate is defeated by Craig in\"[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]\".\nPic32.jpg|The Guinea Pirate escapes from prison.\nCartoon GP.png|''\"Guinea Pirate!\"''\nSPPII3.jpg|True form.\n</gallery>\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nHe has displayed certain superhuman powers. When Chief Aide Davis finds out that he knew the Furry Death would happen, Chertoff kills him by firing a long, prehensile tongue into his eye that causes Davis to go into violent convulsions. He also appears to be able to survive normally lethal gunshots, as a marine attempted to shoot him from behind, but with no discernible effect. Finally, he possesses the ability to shift between his true furry form and that of a man at will.\n\nHowever, he appears to be helpless when faced with [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]'s powers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twelve}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n\n[[zh:迈克尔·切尔托夫]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Military personalities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Jewish characters]]\n[[Category:Realistic characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Animals]]"
