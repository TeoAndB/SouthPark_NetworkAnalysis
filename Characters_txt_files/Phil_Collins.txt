He successfully breaks up the band by convincing [[Skyler]] that Timmy is stealing his thunder. He allows Skyler's new solo band, [[Reach for the Skyler]], to perform at [[Lalapalalapaza|his concert]]. After the kids are taken off [[Ritalin]] at the festival, Collins is promptly booed off the stage. While The Lords of The Underworld begin playing, he is thrown around in the audience and his Oscar is shoved up his ass.\n\nAt the concert, Collins sings a parody of \"You'll Be in My Heart\", as the creators' revenge for \"[[Blame Canada]]\" from ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' losing the Oscar to Collins - the reason being that, while Stone and Parker were prepared to lose the Academy Award for Best Original Song, they were not prepared to lose it to Phil Collins.\n\nCollins later returns in the episode \"[[200]]\" as one of the celebrities suing the town. He and [[Jared Fogle]] are sent by [[Tom Cruise]] to pick up [[Muhammad]], but they are killed when their limo was blown up by [[Ginger Separatist Movement|Ginger Kids]].\n\nIn \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\", a hill named after him, [[Phil Collins Hill]], is used for the sledding competition.\n\n==Personality==\nHe is very arrogant, vengeful, and manipulative. He shows off his Oscar wherever he goes, even though his music shown to be terrible when he performs. He goes out of his way and uses dishonest means to get what he wants. He outwardly expresses his displeasure at Timmy joining the Lords of the Underworld, claiming that people are making fun of him for being handicapped, but it is likely that he is just jealous of the band's success. He goes to extreme measures to break up the band; first by visiting Timmy's parents and later convincing Skyler to leave the band by making him believe that Timmy is stealing his fame. \n\n==Appearance==\nPhil Collins wears a white long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and can be seen holding an Oscar trophy. He has a noticeable 5 o'clock shadow, visible signs of aging, and has receding brown hair. He is almost always scowling.\n\nHis crossed eyes and speaking mannerisms imply that Collins is mentally handicapped in some way.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Phil Collins\">\nTimmy2000038.png\nTimmy2000047.png\nTimmy2000079.png\nTimmy2000083.png\nTimmy2000089.png\nTimmy2000100.png\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Timmy 2000]]\"\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen with the other celebrities suing South Park.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the Mandarin Chinese dub, he is named after [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A8%90%E8%AD%99%E9%BE%8D Gan Giau Long], a popular Taiwanese webtoon character.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Phil Collins]]\n[[zh:菲尔·柯林斯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:British characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]"
