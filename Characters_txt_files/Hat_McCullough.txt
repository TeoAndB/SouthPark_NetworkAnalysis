He also appears as a background character in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\", the [[Season Eight]] episode \"[[Goobacks]]\" and the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode \"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHat McCullogh was initially imprisoned for murdering 23 babies in \"self defense\". The rednecks of [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] misunderstood the advertisement, for a literal \"free hat\", and petitioned the governor to release McCullough. Stan's campaign was actually meant to save films from their directors, who perform unnecessary modifications and re-release them.\n\nHis advertising sign actually promised free hats for anyone participating in his campaign, instead of an appeal to release a McCullough from jail. Hat McCullough was later released around the same time Stan's original campaign's goal was achieved, so his release was credited to [[The Boys|the boys]] for their supposed campaign. On the stage, he expresses spasms of insanity, shouting, \"Kill! Kill the innocent!\" and \"Rape the virgins!\", while thanking the rednecks for their support, then asking for a baby. He gets the fearful toddler, and then performs horrid actions upon it, causing [[Tweek Tweak]] to look and shout, \"Oh my God!\"\n\nHe is seen again in the crowd of \"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" as a war supporter and singing in the final celebration scene.\nHe is later seen in the redneck meetings of \"[[Goobacks]]\". He later reappears as one of the protesting rednecks in \"[[White People Renovating Houses]].\"\n\n==Appearance==\nHat McCullough wears black boots, gray pants, and a blue denim shirt with green trimming. He wears a green belt, has long red hair, and red facial hair.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Free Hat]]\"\n*\"[[Red Sleigh Down]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\"\n*\"[[Goobacks]]\"\n*\"[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]\" - Seen as the crowd left the Park County Community center at the end of the episode.\n*\"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\"\n*\"[[Unfulfilled]]\" - Seen working for Amazon.\n*\"[[Season Finale]]\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[pl:Hat McCullough]]\n[[zh:海特·麦卡洛]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Serial killers]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
