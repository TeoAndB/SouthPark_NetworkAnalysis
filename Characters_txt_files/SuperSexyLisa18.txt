To their left is a monochrome television with a VCR attached and an old desk fan. Behind them are shelves filled with canned, and non-perishable foods. Also behind them is a cot and a pillow. In front of them are several empty bottles of John Adams beer, several smoked cigars, and their computer.\n\n==Appearance==\nSuperSexyLisa18 is overweight, and is most noted by their unprofessionally done tattoos and yellow buzz-cut.
