She was originally voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in \"[[Tweek vs. Craig]]\", then [[Mona Marshall]] later took over that role. However, Annie is now voiced by [[April Stewart]].\n\nAnnie is one of the popular girls in the fourth grade at [[South Park Elementary]]. She is friends with girls such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], [[Red]], [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]], [[Nelly]], [[Jenny Simons|Jenny]], and [[Lola]], along with most of the other [[List of Female 4th Graders|4th grade girls]].\n\n==Background==\n===Name===\nHer name was first heard in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", when she was at the [[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore store]] with [[Wendy Testaburger]], [[Red McArthur]], and [[Bebe Stevens]]. Prior to that, she was referred to as \"Jordan\" in \"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\", though many background characters at the time were frequently called by different names. Despite the finalization of her first name, she was called \"Ashley\" in the [[Season Thirteen]] episode, \"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\", but her first name seemed to have gone back to its current one in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[The Hobbit]]\".\n\nHer surname has changed a lot throughout the series; it was revealed as \"Faulk\" in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", but in the [[Season Seventeen]] episode, \"[[The Hobbit]]\", [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] refers to her as \"Annie Nelson\". However, her other surname, \"Knitts\", was finalized in the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]],'' though she was once again referred to as \" Annie Nelson\" in ''[[South Park: The Fractured But Whole]]''.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe wears a brown collarless jacket and black pants. Her hair is short, light blonde and tight-curly. In \"[[The Hobbit]]\", [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] states that Annie's hair is also thin. In \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\", she wore an aquamarine tube top, a teal-and-aquamarine wrap skirt, and white shoes.\n\nShe wears a pink pajama shirt with a light purple collar when she goes to bed, as shown in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\".\n{{GallerySubPage|name=Annie Knitts}}\n\n==Personality==\nAnnie is portrayed as a kind and friendly person; however, this leads to her being a target for bullying. In ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', she is seen crying because three older girls took her Justin Bieber doll.\n\nAnnie is also rather naïve and innocent minded, admitting that she did not know what a queef was in \"[[Eat, Pray, Queef]]\". Despite her shortcomings, she showed a trait of leadership and convinced Wendy and the rest of the girls to break up with their boyfriends in \"[[Skank Hunt]]\" in an attempt to prove a point about [[Skankhunt42]]'s misdeeds.\n\n==Family==\n===[[Mrs. Knitts]]===\n[[File:Mrs. Polk.JPG|thumb|right|Annie's mother, Mrs. Knitts.]]\n[[Mrs. Knitts|Annie's mother]] was seen with her in \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore (Location)|Stupid Spoiled Whore]]\", buying her things and waiting in line to check out. She had a speaking role, criticizing [[Mr. Testaburger]] for not letting his daughter buy anything in that store.\n\nHer mother is also seen at the parents' meeting in \"[[T.M.I.]]\" sitting with her father; while he is not actually visible, her mother is seen looking off-screen towards someone, in the same manner the other parents look towards each other.\n\n===Other Relatives===\nIn the toy shop in \"[[Woodland Critter Christmas]]\", she is seen trying to get the attention of an unnamed female relative as she holds up a candy cane convincing her to buy it for her. This is most likely not a new mother, as her official [[Mrs. Faulk|mother]] first appeared with her in the [[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset|previous episode]].\n\n==Interactions==\n===4th Grade Girls===\nAnnie is usually seen with the other girls, such as [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]], [[Bebe Stevens|Bebe]], and [[Nichole Daniels|Nichole]]. She is seen mostly with [[Red McArthur|Red]], though.\n\nWhile she is depicted as being part of Wendy's group along with Red, Bebe, Heidi, and Nichole, Annie tends to take a backseat to other characters at some points, such as [[Esther]] and [[Millie Larsen]] in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", [[Red]] and [[Heidi Turner|Heidi]] in \"[[Marjorine]]\", and [[Lola]] and Red in \"[[The List]]\".\n\n===[[Token Black]]===\nAnnie and Token were often seen together in a friendly way in the earlier seasons. They were seen sitting next to each other on the bus in \"[[World Wide Recorder Concert]]\" and \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\" and chatting in class in \"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\". They were also seen playing together on the swing set in \"[[Clubhouses]]\" and holding hands while singing \"[[It's Easy, Mmm'kay]]\" in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.\n\nIn the recent seasons, they are not seen together as often, but they can be seen molding clay together in art class in the [[Season Seven]] episode, \"[[Toilet Paper]]\".\n\n===[[Butters Stotch]]===\nAnnie joined Butters' kissing company in \"[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]\", and they seemed to be on good terms throughout the episode.\n\nHowever, she can be heard in the crowd of girls encouraging [[Nelly]] to fight Butters in \"[[Douche and a Danish]]\", indicating that Annie disapproves of Butters' decision to start the [[Wieners Out (Movement)|Wieners Out]] movement along with the rest of the girls.\n\n===[[Daniel Tanner]]===\n[[File:SkankHunt00036.png|thumb|Annie breaking up with Daniel toward the end of \"[[Skank Hunt]]\".]]\nIn \"[[Skank Hunt]]\", Annie is revealed to have had a boyfriend, [[Daniel Tanner]], with whom she breaks up towards the end of the episode.\n\n==Prominence==\n*''[[The Unaired Pilot]]'' - Seen in class\n*\"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\" - Seen in [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]]'s classroom.\n*\"[[Weight Gain 4000]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - Watches the football game.\n*\"[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]\" - Claps for [[the boys]]' experiment.\n*\"[[Pinkeye]]\" - Seen in a Chewbacca costume.\n*\"[[Death]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\" - Seen in the play.\n*\"[[Damien]]\" - Seen in class and at [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s birthday party.\n*\"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\" - Seen digging for coal.\n*\"[[Starvin' Marvin]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\" - Seen in front of [[the Booktastic Bus]] and in class.\n*\"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\" - Seen talking to [[Token Black|Token]] at the beginning.\n*\"[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]\" - Referred to as \"Jordan\" by [[Stan Marsh]] and gets sent flying and knocked out by a dodgeball in practice.\n*\"[[The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks)]]\" - Seen on the bus.\n*\"[[Summer Sucks]]\" - Seen playing in the band and in the ash with the other kids.\n*\"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" - Seen in class.\n*\"[[Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods]]\" - First speaking role;
