"{{Group\n|name = Meth Heads\n|image = Meth-heads.png\n|gender = Male\n|job = Drug Dealers\n|first = \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\"\n}}\nThe '''Meth Heads''' were a group of drug dealers who appeared in [[Season Seven]] episode \"[[Lil' Crime Stoppers]]\".\n\n==Background==\n[[The Boys]] were assigned a detective case to deal with a meth lab. As they reach the location of the meth lab, the dealers armed themselves with weapons and started firing. However, one of them lost control of his gun, sending a bullet into flammable liquids and subsequently burning another meth head. Two other meth heads tried escaping in a getaway truck, only to be ran over by another truck and burning them as well. The remaining meth head was seen flying a small aircraft, but realized that it ran out of fuel, before crashing into South Park's [[Post Office]].\n\n\n[[zh:制毒者]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]"
