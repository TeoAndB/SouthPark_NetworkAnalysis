She made her first appearance in the [[Season Four]] episode, \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\".\n\n==Background==\nShe first appears in \"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\", briefly, as she directs [[The Boys|the boys]] to her husband. She was later seen in the background when Chef was protesting the [[South Park Flag]] in \"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\", before reappearing in \"[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]\", in which Token begins to question why they are so rich, and while everyone else is poor. It is revealed that Mrs. Black is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company. She is horrified when Token wants to shop at J-Mart, and seems to not understand how to shop like middle-class people.\n\nHer next appearance with a speaking role was in \"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\", in which she and her husband become horrified when discovering that Token has seen the porno-film ''[[Back Door Sluts 9]]'', thinking that it was ''Lord of the Rings''. When her husband [[Steve Black]] then exclaims \"Oh god, not that one!\", Mrs. Black shoots him a furious look.\n\n==Appearance==\nMrs. Black has dreadlocks that are held high with a red bobble. She often wears big-hooped earrings, a white-collared shirt with a green v-neck jumper, a blue skirt, and black shoes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Black family was once named \"The Williams\" in \"Here Comes the Neighborhood\".\n*In \"Proper Condom Use\", [[Sharon Marsh|Sharon]] says she agrees with what Bob and Linda said while at the Book Club. Since the names of all of the other parents present (except Mrs. Tweak) had been given, fans gather it may be the Blacks parents' names. However, in \"The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers\", Mr. Black is referred to as Steve.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000]]\" - Answers the door for Stan and Kyle.\n*\"[[Chef Goes Nanners]]\" - Protests with her husband and [[Jerome \"Chef\" McElroy|Chef]] to change the South Park flag because of its racist connotations.\n*\"[[Here Comes the Neighborhood]]\" - Becomes good friends with the other wealthy black families who move into South Park, until they are driven out by a group of angry residents lead by [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]].\n*\"[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]\" - Horrified that her son watched a porn film.\n*\"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\"- Seen in the crowd of people at the Christmas tree lighting in South Park.\n*\"[[South Park is Gay!]]\" - Appears with the other women in South Park to put an end to the metrosexual fad ruining their relationships.\n*\"[[You Got F'd in the A]]\" - Seen in the crowd watching the dance-off.\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" - Seen in the crowd at the town's meeting.\n*\"[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]\" - Seen in the background.\n*\"[[Pinewood Derby]]\" - Seen in the background.\n*\"[[About Last Night...]]\" - Seen supporting [[Barack Obama]].\n*\"[[Elementary School Musical]]\" - Seen in the audience at the basketball game at [[South Park Elementary]].\n*\"[[Jewpacabra]]\" - Seen at the Easter egg hunt.\n*\"[[Medicinal Fried Chicken]]\"- Seen reading while waiting for soccer practice to end.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Seen in the crowd giving Santa in bear costume to gingers.\n*\"[[It's a Jersey Thing]]\" - Seen in the background.\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Allows the Cartman family to stay at their home after a fire.\n*\"[[Sarcastaball]]\" - Seen at the PTA meeting with all the other parents.\n*\"[[A Scause For Applause]]\" - Seen in the background while [[Jesus Christ]] gives his speech.\n*\"[[The Cissy]]\" - Seen in the background.\n*\"[[The Magic Bush]]\" - She attends the Neighborhood Watch meeting and controls a Neighborhood Watch drone.\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\"- Seen at the [[Whole Foods Market]].\n*\"[[Tweek x Craig]]\" - Seen in the background.\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\"- Seen at the gun show.\n*\"[[Skank Hunt]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Members Only]]\" - Seen shopping when President [[Herbert Garrison|Garrison]] arrives and goes on a tirade.\n*\"[[Not Funny]]\" - Seen at [[Harrison Yates]]' press conference about [[TrollTrace.com]] and at church.\n*\"[[Put It Down]]\" - Seen at the school assembly.\n*\"[[Franchise Prequel]]\"\n*\"[[Doubling Down]]\" - Invites [[Eric Cartman]] to her house and feels bad for Eric that his girlfriend [[Heidi Turner]] broke up with him.\n*\"[[Dead Kids]]\"- Cartman speaks to her and Steve about Black Panther.\n*\"[[A Boy And A Priest]]\" - Seen walking into church.\n*\"[[The Problem with a Poo]]\" - Seen at the Christmas Concert.
