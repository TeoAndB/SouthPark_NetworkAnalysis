When several government agents discover The New Kid and [[Randy Marsh]] hiding out at the clinic, Dr. Poonlover shows up wondering what's going on. When one of the agents tells him that his clinic has been infected with the Nazi Zombie virus, Dr. Poonlover says that he happens to be German himself, resulting in another agent to shoot him several times because he is \"one of them\". After The New Kid gives Randy an abortion and defeats several of the Nazi Zombie fetuses, Dr. Poonlover is shown dying before a giant Nazi Zombie fetus enters the clinic.\n\nHe can be seen in \"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\" alongside other doctors for a seminar on pharmaceuticals, with slightly grayer hair.\n\n==Appearance==\nDr. Poonlover has combed black hair and black eyebrows.
