He made his first appearance in the [[Season One]] episode, \"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\". He used to be a more \"important\" character during the early seasons.\n\n==Background==\nSince his bar's most frequent patrons were generally close-minded and uninviting, the Bartender typically served as the straight man to them, regularly attempting to water down their hostility towards whoever they \"didn't take kindly.\"\n\n==Appearance==\nThe bartender wears a blue jacket with a pocket and a yellow pen on the right side, a brown belt with a gray buckle, pink pants and black boots, his coat buttons are blue when he is seen from the side. He has blond hair and a ponytail, a thick beard and is almost bald, he also has a yellow pencil in one ear. Bartender seems to be taller than most adults, perhaps because of his long legs. He looks a little overweight.\n\nThe bartender's appearance changed slightly in later seasons. Now he wears a dark blue jacket with white buttons, two side pockets and some brown details, a black belt with a yellow buckle and gray pants. He also had some yellow hair and unique eyebrows. Although his appearance has had a big change, he still keeps his legs long and unusual.\n\n==Personality==\nPlacid, but stern, the bartender is easy-going and relaxed. He is authoritative when it comes to keeping his customers under control, and tranquil. He seems to be the only peaceful redneck in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]].\n\n==Trivia==\n*He and [[Hat McCullough]] have a very similar body type. Their legs are distinguishable from those of other ''[[South Park]]'' characters.\n\n==Prominence==\n{{Incomplete|item=list}}\n*\"[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]\" - Debut; seen in the [[Sports Book]].\n*\"[[Damien]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Ike's Wee Wee]]\"\n*\"[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]\" - Calms down [[Skeeter]].\n*\"[[The Red Badge of Gayness]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Cripple Fight]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]\" - Tells the boys there not aloud in the bar.\n*\"[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]\" - Seen among war supporters.\n*\"[[Butt Out]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Goobacks]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" (cameo)\n*\"[[With Apologies to Jesse Jackson]]\" (cameo) - Seen in the bar.\n*\"[[W.T.F.]]\" - Seen at the bar with the other rednecks.\n*\"[[Handicar]]\"\n*\"[[Cock Magic]]\"\n*\"[[The City Part of Town]]\" - Seen at [[SoDoSoPa]].\n*\"[[White People Renovating Houses]]\"\n*\"[[Christmas Snow]]\" - Seen at the beginning of the episode, serving drinks to [[Cliff Barackman]].\n[[fr:Bartender]]\n[[zh:酒保]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Rednecks]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Characters]]\n[[Category:The Stick of Truth: Friendable characters]]"
