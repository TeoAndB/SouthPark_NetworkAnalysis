He was supposed to be [[Butters Stotch|Butters']] \"Accountabilibuddy\", but it was found that he hung himself in his room.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe had short, shiny, brown hair and thick brown eyebrows. He wore the standard Camp New Grace uniform: A blue short-sleeved shirt with a logo of the camp, coffee-brown shorts, white socks, and black shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nHe was presumably gay or bisexual. After Camp New Grace failed to rid him of his attraction to other boys, he was driven to suicide, like how [[Bradley (\"Cartman Sucks\")|Bradley]] almost was.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Eleven}}\n[[pl:Ryan (\"Cartman Sucks\")]]\n[[zh:瑞安（卡特曼舔鸡鸡）]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
