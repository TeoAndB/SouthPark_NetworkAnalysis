She has fair skin. She also wears a light pink shirt, along with pink pants and black shoes. In some episodes, her shirt has a purple heart on it. \n\nIn \"[[Funnybot]]\", she was seen in a dress that was the same color of her pants that she usually wears at the \"[[1st Annual Comedy Awards]]\". Later in the episode, she was seen in her normal clothes. \n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Flora\">\nTrapperKeeper026.png\nTrapperKeeper073.png|Flora being angry at [[Rosie O'Donnell]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Background==\nHer name is likely a play on \"Florida\", as the state was undecided in the presidential election a few days before \"[[Trapper Keeper]]\" aired.\n\nIn \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", Flora was shown to be talented with the piano as she was shown playing it in [[Mr. Mackey]]'s play on \"Tooth Decay\".\n\nIn \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", she had a cameo appearance, where she was shown on one of the [[Toilet Safety Administration|TSA's]] bathroom monitors sitting on a toilet.\n\n===''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''===\nShe appears as one of the six kindergarteners who hides in [[Hide 'n' Seek]].
