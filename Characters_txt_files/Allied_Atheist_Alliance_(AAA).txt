Notably, the AAA is composed entirely of sea otters, who, in the intervening five centuries, have evolved to human cranial capacities.\n\nThe AAA met its end along with the UAL and the UAA, when [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] inadvertently stopped [[Richard Dawkins]] from marrying [[Mrs. Garrison]], erasing the timeline in which they existed.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe AAA consists mostly of sea otters outfitted with gear of widely varying technological levels.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of the Allied Atheist Alliance\" spacing=\"small\">\nGoGodGoXII014.png|Ostrich-mounted sea-otters.\nGoGodGoXII016.png|An AAA detachment with the [[Eric Cartman|Time Child]].\nGoGodGoXII072.png|The AAA prepares for a great confrontation.\nGoGodGoXII137.png|The sea-otters go to war.\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Go God Go]]\"\n*\"[[Go God Go XII]]\"\n\n===''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]''===\nThe leader of the Allied Atheist Alliance narrated the opening sequence to the video game, ''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]'', in story book form, to a group of younger otters, in a dark room with a fireplace.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite claiming to be the most logical name among the three factions for its use of three As, the title is redundant, as the words 'Allied' and 'Alliance' mean the same thing.\n*Several otters can be seen carrying [[w:c:avp:M41A Pulse Rifle|M41A Pulse Rifles]], a fictional weapon originally featured in the film ''[[wikipedia:Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.\n*Several otters can also be seen wearing scouters, fictional devices from the manga and anime series ''[[wikipedia:Dragonball Z|Dragonball Z]]''.\n*They originally had the word \"Allegiance\" in place of \"Alliance\" prior to [[Go God Go]] until it got changed for unknown reasons.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Unified Atheist League (UAL)|Unified Atheist League]]\n*[[United Atheist Alliance (UAA)|United Atheist Alliance]]\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n[[fr:Allied Atheist Alliance (AAA)]]\n[[zh:联合无神联盟]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Atheists]]"
