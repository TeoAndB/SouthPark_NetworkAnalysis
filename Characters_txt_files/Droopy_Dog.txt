His disability makes him both appear and sound like the cartoon character, Droopy Dog.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has a small tuft of red hair and red eyebrows on his head and baggy eyes, with cheeks resembling Droopy from MGM Cartoons. His clothes are the summer camp uniform which almost all of the children at the camp are seen wearing; he is part of the blue team so his shirt is blue, with dark green trousers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Other 4th graders]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Male 4th graders]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters]]\n[[Category:Tardicaca campers]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]"
