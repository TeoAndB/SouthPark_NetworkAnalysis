He appears in the [[Season Fifteen]] episode \"[[1%]]\".\n\n==Background==\nHe comes to [[South Park (Location)|South Park]] to show his support for [[Butters Stotch]] and [[Jimmy Valmer]]'s 99% protest, with his presence being noted on the news. During the protest, he is seen shouting into a large megaphone to vehemently voice his support for their cause.\n\n===''Bowling for Columbine'' and Trey Parker and Matt Stone===\nIn his second full-length documentary ''Bowling for Columbine'', Moore interviewed Matt Stone and Trey Parker regarding Colorado's social climate, as the two grew up in Littleton, CO, to gain more insight on the conditions that shaped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine Massacre students. Though they gave Moore an honest interview and considered their cuts in the movie as fair, they remain on rocky terms with Moore due to him commissioning a South Park style animation bit before their interview, and made without the consent of either of them; the short was that of a bit showcasing KKK related crimes and atrocities due to associations with the NRA. Matt Stone alleges that the short created mistakenly gives the impression that both of them created it themselves, and remain strained with him, calling Moore a filmmaker who cooks context and creates bias through cutting together his films as to provide truth for a one-sided agenda.\n\n==Appearance==\nMoore is grossly overweight with a turkey neck and his gut hanging out. He wears a fern green baseball cap, glasses, a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and gray shoes, and he wields a blue and gray megaphone.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[1%]]\" - Seen outside Red Robin joining Jimmy and Butters' 99% protest.\n*\"[[South ParQ Vaccination Special]]\" - Seen at the end celebrating the end of the pandemic.\n\n==Trivia==\n*He was first parodied in Matt Stone and Trey Parker's puppet movie ''Team America: World Police'', where he was a member of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) who destroys the Team America headquarters in a suicide bombing.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n\n[[zh:迈克尔·摩尔]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
