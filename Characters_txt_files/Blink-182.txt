Hakeem's [[MySpace]] profile states that his favorite band is The White Stripes, while he told everyone in class that his favorite band was Blink-182. This leads Cartman to conclude that Baahir was lying, and thus likely to be a terrorist.\n\nThey are again referenced a few episodes later in \"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\" when [[Thomas]] uses the \"CuteBilly182\" moniker to attract older men to the ''Dateline'' Studio.\n\nTravis Barker appears alone in the [[Season Twelve]] episode \"[[Britney's New Look]]\" at the 2007 MTV music awards.\n\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n[[fr:Blink-182]]\n[[zh:眨眼182]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]"
