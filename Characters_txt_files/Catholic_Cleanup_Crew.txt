They appeared only in the [[Season Twenty-Two]] episode, \"[[A Boy And A Priest]]\".\n\n==Background==\nTheir expertise is to clean a crime scene after the pedophilic activity of a Catholic priest and presumably dispose of any evidence. They utilize standard cleaning equipment but also use a backpack machine called the \"Kumby\" and a Zamboni called the \"Kumboni\", which is a reference to Daniele Comboni. All members were run over and killed by [[Father Maxi]] after they offered him a fine life away from town but implying his replacement would be a sexual predator.\n\nAfter assuming Maxi was on a debaucherous and criminal molestation rampage, they cleaned the [[South Park Church]], [[Marsh Residence|Stan's house]] and the [[Kidzone Roller Rink]]. They have a van containing their cleaning equipment but it was also used to lure [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and lure or kidnap [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Clyde Donovan|Clyde]] to set a trap for Maxi.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe bishop of the crew is overweight, he wears glasses, a white robe, a short pink cloak, a hat in the same color, and a golden cross.\n\nThe person that drives the \"Kumboni\" is a strong and fierce man, he is in black robes, he has grey hair and also wears a cross.\n\nThe person who blows the \"priest call\" whistle wears a white robe with gold designs on it, he has glasses, brown hair and beard.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Catholic Cleanup Crew\">\nSPBP - 00170.png|The crew's van\nSPBP - 00157.png|The Kumby in use\nSPBP - 00175.png|The Kumboni\n</gallery>\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-Two}}\n[[fr:Catholic Cleanup Crew]]\n[[zh:天主清洗团]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Religious characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Pedophillic organizations]]"
