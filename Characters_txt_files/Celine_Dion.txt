She appears in the [[Season Two]] episode, \"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\". She is revealed to be the ex-wife of [[Terrance and Phillip|Terrance]], and the mother of their daughter [[Sally Dion]].\n\n==Background==\nShe has recently started an affair with [[Ugly Bob]], whom she has never seen without a bag over his head. After [[Terrance]] rescues their daughter, he wants to get back together with her. He reveals Ugly Bob's true face to her. However, she decides to stay with Ugly Bob on condition that he always wears the bag on his head. At the end of the episode, she discovers that she is pregnant with him, with a child they both hope will look like her.\n\n==Appearance==\nCeline Dion appears as a Canadian character with their trademark Pac-Man-style heads. In her debut appearance, she wears a purple, long-sleeved shirt with her initials, C.D., written on the front. She is Caucasian and has a full head of brown hair. She also appears to have exaggerated eyelashes.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Celine Dion\">\nPosters.JPG|Celine Dion poster in \"[[The Ring]]\".\nItsChristmasinCanada062.png|Celine Dion's cameo in \"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Dion's song, \"[[There You Are!|My Heart Will Go On]]\", is played in the episode, \"[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]\".\n*In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', in the song \"[[La Resistance]]\", [[Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] sings the lyrics ''\"When Canada is dead and gone, there'll be no more Celine Dion!\"''\n**The lyrics were also used in Robin Williams' performance of \"[[Blame Canada]]\" at the 72nd Academy Awards.\n*In \"[[The Simpsons Already Did It]]\", she is mentioned on the \"Terrance & Phillip show\" where Terrance says that \"he might have accidentally killed Celine Dion\" in which Phillip responds \"killing is not an accident you dick face!\"\n**The same mentioning can be heard on various televisions in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', that play that episode of the show.\n*Celine Dion is the only Canadian celebrity who is portrayed with an oval head, rectangular body, and beady eyes, like other Canadians on the show. Despite [[Paul Watson]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Tom Green]], the \"[[Star Wars Kid]]\", Edge, and [[Justin Bieber]] being Canadian they look like normal instinctive characters. This was likely done because Trey and Matt wanted the audience to recognize them more easily. In \"[[Royal Pudding]]\", [[Rush|RUSH]], [[Bryan Adams]], and [[Corey Hart]] are Canadian musicians like Celine Dion, who is portrayed with an oval head, rectangular body, and beady eyes.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]\" - Debut appearance.\n*\"[[It's Christmas in Canada]]\" - Cameo during music number.\n*\"[[The Ring]]\" - Cameo appearance on a poster.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Celine Dion]]\n[[fr:Celine Dion]]\n[[ja:セリーヌ・ディオン]]\n[[zh:席琳·迪翁]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Canadians]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]"
