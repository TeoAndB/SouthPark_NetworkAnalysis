He is possibly Mr. Mackey's landlord.\n\n==Background==\nWhen [[Mr. Mackey]] is going to [[Mackey Residence|his house]], Mr. Freely shows up and says he changed the locks after learning that Mackey had \"offered drugs to 4th grade students\". After a brief discussion, Mr. Freely throws a rock at Mackey, causing him to flee.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Freely is almost bald. He has spiky gray hair on the side of his head and some warts on his face. The left side of his head looks quite deformed. He wears a white tank top under a blue jumpsuit with one pocket in the middle and black shoes and is usually seen smoking a cigar. He had told Mackey that he had not used any drugs and was completely fine, but that is probably a lie, as his appearance turned out to be quite unusual.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n[[zh:弗里利先生]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Elderly people]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]"
