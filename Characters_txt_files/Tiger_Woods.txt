He appears primarily as a video game avatar, for his latest golf-game, ''[[List of Video Game References#Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11|Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11]]'', which, in truth, is more of a domestic abuse fighting game in which Tiger Woods and his [[Elin Nordegren|wife]], beat each other up following Tiger's constant sexual affairs. The game is a big hit for the boys, who find the idea of beating the crap out of Woods highly entertaining.\n\nHowever, when a group of scientists come up with the outrageous theory that rich and famous men are having affairs solely because of an uncontrollable source, such as addiction, the real Tiger immediately claims that it is the reason he cheated on his wife so much. He, along with a group of other celebrities, as well as [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Butters Stotch]], who are also diagnosed as sexual addicts, check into the [[Karne Institute for Sex Addiction]]. The Institute, however, does not teach its patients to control their addiction, but instead they teach them how to avoid getting caught again.\n\nLater, President [[Barack Obama]] claims that sexual addiction is caused by a \"[[Wizard Alien]]\". Kyle and Butters later kill the Wizard Alien, who was actually a soldier who was willing to admit the truth about the \"Sexual Addiction\" matter, but was labeled by the government as a \"turd in the punchbowl\".\n\nFollowing the death of the Wizard Alien, Woods and the other 'addicts' claim to be cured of their illness. Woods gives a speech saying that it's good that the sex addiction is gone and that he can be faithful to his wife. He also states that his wife would not have to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys (at which point his wife looks at him and says nothing, implying that she will or has already slept with other guys) and that he will return to golf.\n\nHis video game meanwhile has reverted to its original state, much to the disdain of [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Eric Cartman]].\n\n==Appearance==\nTiger Woods wears brown pants, a blue shirt, and a dark blue business coat. He has short, black hair and has black facial hair.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In \"[[200]]\", he was one of the celebrities suing South Park.\n*The ''[[The Spirit of Christmas|Jesus Vs Santa]]'' short can be accessed in the PlayStation 1 version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf by opening a file on Windows called <code>ZZDUMMY.DAT</code> with a media player.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Sexual Healing]]\"\n*\"[[200]]\" - Seen as one of the angry celebrities suing South Park.\n*\"[[201]]\" - Seen as one of the angry celebrities suing South Park.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fourteen}}\n{{SportsCelebrities}}\n[[zh:泰格·伍兹]]\n[[Category:Sports celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:200 and 201 celebrities]]\n[[Category:Minority characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:African-American characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Buddhists]]"
