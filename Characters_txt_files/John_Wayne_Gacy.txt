The killers' antics parodied the slapstick violence of ''The Three Stooges'' films with murder. The trio renamed ''The Three Murderer's'' with Gacy being the role of \"Curly\" Bundy acting as \"Moe\" and Dahmer as \"Larry\".\n\nThroughout the episode he murders four people, resulting in him being slapped by Ted Bundy each time. Unlike the other two, Gacy seemed to have been revived, although he is now blinded because Bundy ripped his eyes right out of his head.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has short, gray hair and a black mustache. He is very overweight. He wears a light gray \"dress\" shirt and gray pants.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" caption=\"Images of Ted Bundy\" spacing=\"small\">\nGacy.png|Gacy, murdering a chef.\nGacy2.png|Gacy murdering another chef.\nGacy3.png|Gacy murdering an innocent, who offered to help him, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer with loading the Ferrari cake.\nGacy4.png|Gacy covered in cake and blood.\nGacy5.png|Gacy after having his eyes ripped out by [[Ted Bundy]].\nTheThreeMurderers.png|'\"The Three Murderers: Gacy, Bundy, and Dahmer\"''<nowiki/>''\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*He and the other two killers were characters destined to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' but were cut in the final version. Their friend icons can still be found in the game files.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Ten}}\n{{CriminalCelebrities}}\n[[zh:约翰·韦恩·盖西]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Serial killers]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters from Hell]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Criminal celebrities]]"
