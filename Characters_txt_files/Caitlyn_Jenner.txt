She transitioned into a female because of how she felt throughout her life as a man. The main focus of the episode \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" is how [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] does not believe she is a hero for coming out as transgender.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\", a man who read [[Butters Stotch|Butters]]' book ''[[The Poop That Took a Pee]],'' murders the [[Kardashians]], including Bruce Jenner. The book was written by Butters himself and went on to critical acclaim as well as controversy.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was first mentioned in \"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" when [[PC Principal]] reprimands and sends Kyle to detention for saying she is not a hero. Later on in the episode, Kyle takes back this statement in desperation to stop [[Eric Cartman|Cartman's]] attack on the [[PC Delta|PC house]] and to stop being targeted by PC Principal and [[Randy Marsh]].\n\nIn \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\", Kyle meets Jenner during a speech given by [[Barack Obama|Obama]] celebrating Kyle's newfound tolerance speech. Obama surprises Kyle during the speech, saying that he'll get to ride back to South Park \"by his hero.\" As they leave the [[White House]], Jenner carelessly runs over and kills a pedestrian. At the end of the episode, [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] announces his candidacy for president, and announces Caitlyn Jenner as his running mate, meaning that Caitlyn Jenner was a Mr. Garrison supporter. Much like before, she and Garrison drive away, only for her to hit and kill a pedestrian as they leave.\n\nCaitlyn reappears in \"[[Sponsored Content]]\" where she aids Mr. Garrison in his debate against [[Hillary Clinton]]. She steps in during the debate to say that Hillary looks like a donkey took a shit on her face. After hearing about the conspiracy in [[South Park (Location)|South Park]], she later drives Mr. Garrison and [[Principal Victoria]] back to South Park. Much like before, she winds hitting and killing a pedestrian along the way. This time, she runs over an entire crowd of people.\n\nIn \"[[Truth and Advertising]]\", they are shocked to see what has happened to the town since they left. She assists Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria in an attack against the [[PC Bros]].\n\n==Appearance==\nJenner is shown to have severely deformed facial features, in reference to her real-life facial feminization surgery.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Caitlyn Jenner\">\nTaleofScrotieMcBoogerballs41.jpg|Bruce Jenner gets killed in \"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\".\nCaitlynJennerProductionArt.jpg|Production art for her appearance in \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\".\nCaitlyn Jenner.png|Caitlyn Jenner in \"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\"\nGarrison_without_glasses.png|Caitlyn with [[Principal Victoria]] and [[Herbert Garrison]].\nMemberBerries00017.png|Caitlyn, and Garrison celebrating in \"[[Member Berries]]\".\nOhJeez00013.png|Caitlyn throwing up on [[Randy Marsh|Randy]].\nFortCollins00040.png|Caitlyn Jenner drinking in \"[[Fort Collins]]\".\ncaitlyn jenner 1.png|''Buckle up buckaroo!''\n</gallery>\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs]]\" - Seen on The Kardashians as Bruce Jenner.\n*\"[[Stunning and Brave]]\" (mentioned only) - Kyle does not believe she is a hero for coming out as a transgender.\n*\"[[Where My Country Gone?]]\" - Gives Kyle a ride back to South Park and later becomes Mr. Garrison's running mate for the next upcoming election.\n*\"[[Sponsored Content]]\" - Aids Mr Garrison in his presidential campaign.\n*\"[[Truth and Advertising]]\" - Helps [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] and [[Principal Victoria]] in the attack against the fraternity brothers.\n*\"[[PC Principal Final Justice]]\"\n*\"[[Member Berries]]\"\n*\"[[Douche and a Danish]]\" - Seen in as part of Mr. Garrison's campaign.\n*\"[[Fort Collins]]\" - Seen drinking a gin and tonic spiked with a [[Memberberries|member berry]].\n*\"[[Oh, Jeez]]\" - Becomes VP-elect and seen infecting [[Randy Marsh]] with Memberberries.\n*\"[[Members Only]]\" - Comments on President Garrison's presidential transformation.\n\n{{TelevisionCelebrities}}\n\n[[fr:Caitlyn Jenner]]\n[[ja:ケイトリン・ジェンナー]]\n[[pl:Caitlyn Jenner]]\n[[zh:凯特琳·詹纳]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Revived characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Television celebrities]]\n[[Category:Garrison Administration staff]]"
