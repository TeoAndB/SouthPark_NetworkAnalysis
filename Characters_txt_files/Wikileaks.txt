He is also the older brother of [[Lemmiwinks]]. Wikileaks was shown to be intelligent enough to operate a computer, and record things with a helmet cam.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Wikileaks' name and character is a reference to Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks, on which leaked government documents are posted and made available for download. The character's hair also resembles Assange's.\n*Wikileaks is also used to reference the rat and villain \"Martin\" from ''The Secret of NIMH 2''.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Fifteen}}\n[[zh:泄密鼠]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Pets]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]"
