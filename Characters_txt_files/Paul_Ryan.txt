He appears in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode \"[[Doubling Down]]\".\n\n==Background==\nPaul Ryan, [[Mike Pence]], and [[Mitch McConnell]] enter the Oval Office where [[Herbert Garrison|President Garrison]] is conversing with another world leader on the phone. When he hangs up they inform him about right pronunciation of an African country Niger and about worker with ties to [[Russia]] was found \"raped and executed\". To that the President responds that it was him. Paul warns him that people are starting to question his oath to the office, to which he reminds them that his oath to the office was that he would \"fuck everyone to death.\" After this the [[Memberberries]] on a shelf pester them and Garrison tells them to be quiet. To his advisers he says to put a positive spin on the situation. Ryan refuses to help and says that maybe he should put his foot down. In response, Garrison remotely closes the door behind them and tells them: \"Hope you brought some condoms.\"\n\nAfter the Middle East peace conference in which the President refers to the people of Saudi Arabia as \"a bunch of dirty sand Nigers\", Ryan is questioned by a reporter in front of the White House about Garrisons' presidency. He responds that the President is doing great and he is sticking by him 100%, adding that people do not know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They then ask him about the semen on his black eye to which he nervously responds that he tripped on a doorknob and that it is doorknob cum.\n\nRyan is later seen with Pence and McConnell wearing blankets over their suits discussing their chances of survival. Then he shows them the President's approval ratings which are dangerously low. Suddenly President Garrison walks in and asks them what they are doing. They all quickly tell him that they were doing nothing before Mike Pence takes the folder out of his hand and gives it to the President. Ryan calls Pence a bitch and tells the President that he researched the poll, not Pence. They then get into a small fist fight while Garrison looks at the folder. When they stop Garrison tells them everything is going to be fine for him.\n\nAt Garrison's first anniversary in the office, Ryan brings him a cake and sings the song \"Happy Anniversary to you\" with Pence and McConnell. When Garrison blows out the candles, they clap and congratulate him. McConnell comments that more years of the same are to come, to which Garrison responds that he does not think so and walks out from behind his desk with a giant dildo strapped to his genitals. Instead he remarks that next three years are gonna be even better. All of them laugh in response, but soon begin to cry, knowing what that dildo means.\n\n==Appearance==\nPaul Ryan wears a dark-blue suit with a red and light blue striped tie and white shirt. He has black hair and black eyebrows. After he was raped by President Garrison, he is seen wearing light blue blanket over his suit.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Paul Ryan\">\nSPDD - 00020.png\nSPDD - 00022.png\nSPDD - 00033.png\nSPDD - 00060.png\nSPDD - 00110.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{PoliticalCelebrities}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Twenty-One}}\n[[zh:保罗·瑞安]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Political celebrities]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with unknown voice actor]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Catholic characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Garrison Administration staff]]"
