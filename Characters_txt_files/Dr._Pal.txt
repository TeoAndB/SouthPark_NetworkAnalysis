He has brown hair and no facial hair. He has no other distinguishing features.\n\n==Personality==\nHe seemed to be a man who tried too hard to be relatable to kids, with wacky hand gestures and lingo to embarrass Jimmy. He also asked Jimmy if they could take off their shirts and kiss, so it is revealed he is just a pedophile who just has a doctor's job to molest kids. When Jimmy refuses, Dr. Pal refuses to help, showing he does not actually care about Jimmy's problems and only wanted to molest him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nine}}\n[[zh:帕尔医生]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Medics]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
