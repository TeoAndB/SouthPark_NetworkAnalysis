She tells Foofa not to sell out her strange to those \"corporate bastards\". They end up singing a song about not showing your strange on TV, which ends with O'Connor singing about looking for a boyfriend. This attempt also fails.\n\n==Appearance==\nO'Connor has very short brown hair and brown eyebrows. She wears a maroon colored top, a maroon colored skirt, and black high heel shoes. She has multiple tattoos on her body, including a \"B\" and a \"Q\" on her cheeks, a large [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] tattoo on her chest, and some other tattoos on her arms.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Sinéad O'Connor\">\nTamingStrange00041.png|O'Connor singing with Yo Gabba Gabba\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Her role in the episode is a reference to her real-life criticism of Miley Cyrus' promiscuous public image in 2013, which is what inspired Foofa's role in the episode.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Seventeen}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n[[zh:希妮德·奥康娜]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]"
