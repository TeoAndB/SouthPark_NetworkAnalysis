He first appears in \"[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]\". He later appears in \"[[Britney's New Look]]\" with an updated design.\n\n==Background==\nHe first appears in \"[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]\" to help the boys' record dialogue for their film. As Kyle and Cartman start to insult each other, Bruce laughs and suggests that they should add those lines into the script.\n\nIn \"[[Britney's New Look]]\", he appears in the recording studio to help [[Britney Spears]] record a new single, despite losing most of her upper head after a failed suicide. Stan and Kyle watch as she attempts to sing, only to hear everyone else in the room insult her.

A few seconds in, Bruce and the producer give each other a high five, believing that they have a hit single.\n\n==Appearance==\nIn \"[[A Very Crappy Christmas]]\", he had light brown hair and wore a black t-shirt with \"95.2 ROCKS.
