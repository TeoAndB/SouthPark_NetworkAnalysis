Her face can be seen on the advertisements for gift cards.

She has blonde hair that goes down to around shoulder length. She wears blue eye shadow. In \"[[Reverse Cowgirl]]\", she is seen in a black top with a white stripe going from the right hip to the left shoulder. In \"[[Unfulfilled]]\", she wears a white shirt, with a dark pink heart on it, a pink skirt and black shoes.\n\n==Personality==\nShe appears to be a supervisor or a head waitress of some sorts, even having her headshot on Raisins' advertisements.
