His first appearance was in the [[Season Fourteen]] episode, \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\". He was also seen briefly in \"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]\" and in \"[[Butterballs]]\".\n\n==Background==\n===Character===\nKip seems to be an outcast, who has no friends at all because everyone made fun of his appearance. In fact, he went six months on Facebook without a ''single'' friend request. As a result, he seemed to suffer from severe depression and would sit at his computer all day, waiting and praying for a friend request. This changed when [[Kyle Broflovski]] felt sorry for him and added him as a result.\n\nKyle's addition overjoyed Kip who began thinking of Kyle's Facebook friendship as a much deeper thing, and began to address Kyle as his best friend, where sometimes he would wait for hours just staring at his Facebook page just for Kyle to reply and bring his computer to the movies while taking pictures of himself with Kyle's Facebook page. He would then proceed to tell his parents all the inane details of their collective Facebook updates.\n\nUnfortunately, Kip's status as a loser negatively affected Kyle, who lost all his Facebook friends except for Kip and later [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] (who Kyle had to beg to friend him). [[Eric Cartman]] meanwhile features Kyle and Kip on his podcast, Mad Friends, in which he informs Facebook participants to steer clear of Kyle because of his association with Kip. Although reluctant at first, Kyle eventually removes him as a friend, resulting in Kip falling back into his depressed state. However, by the end of the episode, he had 845,323 friends on Facebook, due to Stan shutting down [[Profile Stan Marsh|his profile]] and transferring his friends to Kip, thus restoring Kip to being extremely overjoyed.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe has brown hair that is long, scraggly, and parted down the middle. He wears a green shirt and blue shorts. His hair also seems to be receding on the forehead, like his father. He has a slight lisp and either has an over-bite or is simply biting on his lower lip. He is also noticeably chubby. Overall, Kip Drordy seems to share a resemblance to Rocky Dennis of the film ''Mask''. When depressed he positions himself in the exact same way as a \"Crying Clown\" poster on his wall.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Kip Drordy\">\nKip-drordy-camera.png|Kip Drordy appearance in \"[[Butterballs]]\"\nKip-drordy-cinema.png|Kip Drordy in cinema\nKip-drordy-dinner.png|Kip Drordy Dinner\nKip's_Parents.png|Kip's parents.\nKip.jpg|Kip, as seen on South Park Studios.\nYouhave0Friends03.jpg|Kip and his \"Crying Clown\" poster.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nKip is an outcast. This has negatively affected his personality in many ways. He seems extremely insecure, becoming depressed over having no Facebook friends in \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\". He also seems obsessive, even taking his computer to the movies in order to \"watch a movie with Kyle\" (Kyle was, at the time, his only Facebook friend).\n\n==Family==\n===[[Mr. and Mrs. Drordy]]===\nKip has a mother and a father, whose names are currently unknown. They both appear to be extremely loving and supportive of their son, both realizing, much to their sorrow, that he's an outcast with no friends. As such they are willing to listen to his insane rambling about Kyle. They may or may not realize that Kip is talking about Facebook and not an actual human friend.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Kyle Broflovski]]===\nIn \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\" Kyle was Kip's one and only Facebook friend. Kip grew obsessive over Kyle, later becoming extremely depressed when Kyle \"unfriended\" him. They did not have a real-life friendship.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Kip's birthday is seen on his profile as of July 17, 2003. This would make him 6 years, 8 months, and 22 days old at the episode's premiere, and making him well below Facebook's established rule of users needing to be 13 years old. This was also ignored for the rest of the episode's underage characters.\n*Kip's official Facebook page can be found by [http://www.facebook.com/KipDrordy clicking here].\n*Although Kip was never mentioned again in the later episodes, he occasionally makes appearances as a background character who always hangs out alone. He is also used as a 'filler' character.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\" - Facebook friends with Kyle.\n*\"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]\" - Seen in the playground.\n*\"[[Butterballs]]\" - Seen in Stan's anti-bullying video.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{South Park Children}}\n[[es:Kip Drordy]]\n[[it:Kip Drordy]]\n[[ru:Кип Дрорди]]\n[[zh:基普·卓迪]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:3rd graders]]"
