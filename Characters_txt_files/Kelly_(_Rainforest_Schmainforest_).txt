"{{South Park character\n|name = Kelly\n|image = Kelly-scout.png\n|gender = Female\n|hair = Blonde\n|age = 9-10\n|job = Student\n|grade = [[The 4th Grade|4th Grade]]\n|religion = Roman Catholic\n|voice = [[Toddy Walters]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705955/|title=\"South Park\" Rainforest Shmainforest (TV episode 1999)|publisher=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\"\n}}{{LinkDisambig|Kelly (Disambiguation)}}\n'''Kelly''' was [[Kenny McCormick]]'s girlfriend who first appears in the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\".\n\n==Background==\nShe fell in love with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] in this episode, but she didn't want to get close to him since they live on the opposite sides of the country. She did get close to him, though and, as depicted in \"[[Spontaneous Combustion]]\", their relationship continued to the point where Kenny was taking frequent bus trips to see her. Despite this, she never gets Kenny's name right due to his mumbled speech, referring to him with similar-sounding names such as \"Lenny\", \"Benny\", and various other incorrect names, even though she has heard his name before from other people, like Cartman and Stan.\n\n===Talents===\nShe knows CPR, in \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\", she saved Kenny from dying after he was struck by lightning, by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Because of this act, Kelly should be noted as, arguably, the first character on the show to actually care about Kenny's death, she questions \"who\" [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] are talking about when they say \"''They killed Kenny,''\" and says they should do something to try and help him, the concept of which is utterly lost of Stan and Kyle. She also must have some talent singing and dancing, as she was a member of the \"[[Getting Gay With Kids]]\" choir.\n\n==Appearance==\nShe has blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, wears a blue sweater with green trim with a flower embroidered on one side, and dark blue pants. The band which ties her hair back is green.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Kelly\">\nRainforestShmainforest005.png|Kelly in her \"[[Getting Gay With Kids|Getting Gay With Kids!]]\" uniform.\nRainforestShmainforest031.png|Kelly performing \"[[Getting Gay With Kids (Song)|Getting Gay With Kids]]\" song.\nRainforestShmainforest089.png|Tied up beside Kenny.\nRainforestShmainforest096.png|Kelly attempts to revive Kenny after being struck by lightning.\nKelly_friend_icon.png|Kelly as she was supposed to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nIn \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\", she seems to have issues with severing relationships, even, albeit temporarily, preventing herself from getting in a relationship with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. She also has a bad nose-picking habit. She is rather sweet, and is one of the few people to actually show concern for him when he dies. She even called Kyle and Stan out on their usual \"They killed Kenny\" catchphrase, asking who killed him. She does have a habit of saying his name wrong, though.\n\n==Relationships==\n===[[Kenny McCormick]]===\nKelly was Kenny's first girlfriend. Kelly originally didn't want to date Kenny, knowing that they would be away from each other after the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir leaves [[Costa Rica]]. She later decided that she would date Kenny, as long as they called each other every other day. Due to the events of \"[[The Ring]]\", it can be assumed that their relationship is over.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Despite making a few cameos in later episodes, Kelly is often mistaken for being a one-off character.\n*Kelly is one of the few characters who actually struggles to understand Kenny's muffled speech.\n*Although most of their interactions happen offscreen, her relationship with Kenny did actually last a while. However, it is unknown when or why they broke up.\n*Kelly was supposed to appear in ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'', however, she was ultimately scrapped. Given the events of The Ring, it is unknown what her role would've been.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\" - Her debut, she appeared as a member of the [[Getting Gay With Kids]] choir.\n*\"[[Spontaneous Combustion]]\" - Mentioned only.\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - She was seen briefly in the theater.\n*\"[[Hooked on Monkey Phonics]]\" - She was seen at the school dance.\n*\"[[Casa Bonita]]\" - Seen in the montage where [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] ripped on Kyle for being Jewish.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n\n[[es:Kelly (personaje)]]\n[[zh:凯莉]]\n[[fr:Kelly (Tropicale schtropicale)]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:4th graders]]\n[[Category:Female 4th graders]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Toddy Walters]]\n[[Category:School children]]\n[[Category:Getting Gay with Kids]]\n[[Category:Background characters]]"
