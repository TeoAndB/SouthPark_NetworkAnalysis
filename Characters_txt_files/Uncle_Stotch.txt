He was later mentioned in the [[Season Ten]] episode, \"[[The Return of Chef]]\".\n\n==Background==\nUncle Stotch lives in [[Los Angeles]], California with his wife, [[Nellie Stotch|Nellie]]. Butters and [[Eric Cartman]], who was disguised as [[A.W.E.S.O.M.-O 4000]] while playing a prank on Butters. The Uncle and Aunt play along thinking Cartman is really into pretending to be a robot. The family take the boys on a sightseeing tour of Los Angeles.\n\n==Appearance==\nUncle Stotch has brown, curly hair and has a five o’clock Shadow. He has thick eyebrows and has wrinkles on his face. He wears a light blue button-up shirt over a plain white t-shirt. He wears a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap, which indicates that he may be a fan of the team.\n\n==Personality==\nUncle Stotch appears to be friendly and good with children as he plays along with Eric's \"robot\" persona despite finding it somewhat weird.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In \"[[The Return of Chef]]\" Butters reveals to have been molested by his Uncle Budd, and seems unaware of the severity of the situation. Nellie's husband is never named in the episode itself so it is unsure if he is the uncle Butters is referring to as his family tree is mostly unknown.\n**In the Live Tweet for \"[[AWESOM-O]]\", they were identified by the official South Park account as 'Uncle Bud and Aunt Nellie'. <ref>[https://twitter.com/southpark/status/481975881426944000?lang=en Uncle Bud & Aunt Nelly debut here.
