He appears once in the [[Season Three]] episode, \"[[The Succubus]]\".\n\n==Appearance==\nDoctor Lout is old in appearance, with wrinkles on his face and neck. He has grey hair and facial hair. He wears a doctor's lab coat with a pen in one of the pockets. He also wears a light brown shirt with a tie under his doctor's lab coat.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:TheSuccubus086.png|thumb|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] uses [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s eyes as donors to replace his own.]]\n*He produces incorrect results for Cartman, showing him any slides he deems funny. Despite Cartman's clear vision of all the slides, he says he still has something wrong with his eyes.\n*The Eye Doctor apparently has enough skill to take out a person's eyes and replace them with another person's, as he does so Cartman and Kenny, the latter being dead. There is no known real-life medical procedure capable of a transplant of this nature.\n*At the end of the episode, Doctor Lout asked Eric if he had 3.50$ he could borrow, something the Loch Ness monster from Thomas McElroy's stories continuously asked him for, usually through a variety of disguises. Whether or not this meant Lout was the Loch Ness monster disguising itself as a human or this was purely coincidental was never revealed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n[[uk:Доктор Лаут]]\n[[zh:劳特医生]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]\n[[Category:Bullies]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Medics]]"
