He taught [[Officer Barbrady]] on how to read through a series of clues left in his books. Through the clues, the driver was revealed to be the serial rapist of chickens called the \"Chickenlover\". He was seen falling unconscious when Barbrady struck him in the head with a police club.\n\nHowever, he appears to have recovered. In ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', during the song \"[[Mountain Town]]\", [[Gerald Broflovski]] reads a newspaper with the article \"Bookmobile Driver Released!\" on the front page with a photograph of the Book Mobile driver.\n\n==Criminal record==\n*'''Bestiality''': In \"[[Chickenlover]]\", he molested and raped numerous chickens.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe had large ginger hair with a mustache and a small goatee. He wore a purple top with a rainbow vest and a white cape with rainbows. He also wore purple bell bottoms adorned with a rainbow design on each leg.\n\n<gallery>\nChickenlover81.png|The Book Mobile Driver wearing a mask caught by Barbrady.\nChickenlover85.png|[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] beating the Book Mobile Driver.\nChickenlover87-1.png|The Book Mobile Driver after being struck by Barbrady.\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nHe was a very eccentric and flowery individual, who was highly passionate about the wonders of reading and took great enjoyment in teaching others about reading. However, he was also very sexually disturbed, as he molested numerous chickens, meaning he engaged in bestiality. That was something he saw as perfectly natural and acceptable. Despite the disgusting and illegal nature of such behavior. Owing further to this dementia, the fact that he used this practice to make Barbrady more literate highly suggests a self righteous \"ends-justify-the-means\" kind of mindset.\n\n==Prominence==\n*\"[[Chickenlover]]\" - Operated The Booktastic Bus and raped chickens.\n*''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' - Seen in a newspaper article.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Two}}\n[[fr:Book Mobile Driver]]\n[[zh:流动图书馆司机]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Characters voiced by Trey Parker]]\n[[Category:Gingers]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
