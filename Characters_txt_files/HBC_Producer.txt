Then he decides to push the limits further by saying the word twice, and he eventually turns a sitcom into \"Must Shit TV\" where everyone's written lines are entirely composed of \"shit\".\n\n[[Chef]] and the boys come to his meeting room and try to remind him of the serious consequences of doing so. However, the producer is totally unaware, he simply ignores them and sends them away. One of the knights from [[The Knights of Standards and Practices]] breaks in and attempts to kill the producer, but fails due to security guards. The producer's plan goes on.\n\nOn their sitcom live, the Knights of Standards and Practices appear again, demanding the producer to stop the show.

In order to prove his authority, the producer says the curse word \"shit\" so many times, but ends up summoning [[Geldon]] unintentionally.\n\nWitnessing the consequences himself, the producer finally confesses his faults in front of [[The Knights of Standards and Practices]].
