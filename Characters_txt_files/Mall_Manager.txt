He often ends a sentence or conversation by pausing and asking 'What?' regardless of context.\n\n==Background==\nIn \"[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]\", [[The Boys]] go to the [[South Park Mall]] as their boy band [[Fingerbang]] so they can audition for the mall manager and perform at the mall. The mall manager refuses to let them perform because there is a sausage and cheese cart in the plaza and he doesn't want to move it on the side for a while. Cartman comes back later to show the manager a video they shot, but it ends up getting ruined by [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]]'s antics. Despite this, the manager finally allows the band to perform, but tells them to get out when [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] dies before they start performing. They perform nonetheless and appear to be a hit.\n\nHe is not seen or mentioned in the \"[[Black Friday]]\" trilogy, and a different mall manager is seen.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe mall manager has brown hair and brown eyebrows. He wears a dark green vest over a white collared shirt with a red and green tie, black pants, and black shoes. He also seems to have odd speech mannerisms, such as randomly saying \"What?\" and \"Hey!\" and acting somewhat nervous.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of the Mall Manager\">\nSomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger034.png|The manager at his desk.\nSomethingYouCanDoWithYourFinger075.png|The manager with [[The Boys]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*He is voiced by Marcus Vaughn, a friend of ''[[South Park]]'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] who also appeared in their film ''[[wikipedia:Orgazmo|Orgazmo]]''.\n*He seems to be turned on by the roleplaying sex tape between [[Liane Cartman]] and [[Mr. Mackey]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[zh:商城经理（乐团风云）]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Unnamed characters]]\n[[Category:Townsfolk]]"
