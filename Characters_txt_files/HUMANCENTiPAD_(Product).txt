"{{South Park character\n|name = HUMANCENTiPAD\n|image = HumanCentiPad01 press.jpg\n|gender = Various\n|hair = Various\n|job = Apple Product for Consumer Use\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<br>[[Matt Stone]]<br>[[April Stewart]]\n|appearance = \"[[HUMANCENTiPAD]]\"\n}}\nThe '''HUMANCENTiPAD''' consists of [[Junichi Takiyama]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], and an unnamed woman. They became the HUMANCENTiPAD against their will, as they did not read iTunes' Terms and Conditions. This was because Junichi could not read English, Kyle thought nobody read the Terms and Conditions, and the woman was in a hurry and did not have enough time to read it. \n\n==Appearance==\nThe HUMANCENTiPAD consists of the three characters surgically attached mouth-to-anus. There is an iPad attached to the woman's butt, and an iPhone attached to Junichi Takiyama's forehead. Junichi and the unnamed woman wear knee pads, while Kyle is attached is in the air, held up by his lips, anus, and presumably elastic, fabric. The people that the HUMANCENTiPAD is \"made of\" are almost completely naked, only wearing underwear and fabric wrapped around the lower portion of their heads.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of the HUMANCENTiPAD\">\nHUMANCENTiPAD062.png|Cartman trying his hands on the HUMANCENTiPAD.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The HUMANCENTiPAD is a reference to the 2009 horror film ''The Human Centipede'', where a doctor surgically attaches three people mouth-to-anus.\n[[zh:人体iPad（物品）]]\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]"
