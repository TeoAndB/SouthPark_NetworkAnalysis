"{{South Park character\n|name = Mr. Donaldson\n|image = Adults-mr-donaldson.png\n|gender = Male\n|hair = Brown\n|job = Tourettes Counselor\n|voice = [[Trey Parker]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995582/|title=\"Le Petit Tourette\" on IMDB}}</ref>\n|appearance = \"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\"\n}}\n'''Mr. Donaldson''' is a member of the [[Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation]], who appears in \"[[Le Petit Tourette]]\". He labels [[Kyle Broflovski]] as a bully, as he was unaware that [[Eric Cartman]] is faking his [[Tourette's Syndrome|Tourette's syndrome]].\n\n==Personality==\nAs a sufferer of Tourette's himself, he has his own verbal tic - randomly saying the words \"piss\" and \"ass\" (particularly spouting things about things going in or out of his ass). He also seems very devoted to teaching others about Tourette's syndrome, even to the point of ignoring any evidence that someone would be faking it, as well as claiming that anyone who thinks otherwise is a \"bully\". He appears to be unintelligent and narrow-minded, as he is foolish to regard [[Kyle Broflovski]] as a so-called \"bully\", and to believe [[Eric Cartman]] genuinely suffered from Tourette's syndrome when he was obviously faking it.\n\n==Appearance==\nMr. Donaldson has short, brown hair. He wears a white shirt under a brown suit, a green tie, and dark gray pants.\n<gallery widths=\"160\" captionalign=\"left\" caption=\"Images of Mr. Donaldson\">\nDonaldson2.png|''\"Ass!
