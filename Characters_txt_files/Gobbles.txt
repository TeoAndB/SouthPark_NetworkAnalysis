The Musical]]\"\n}}{{Featured Winner|April 2013}}\n'''Gobbles''' is a disabled turkey that appears in the [[Season Four]] episode, \"[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]\".\n\n==Background==\nGobbles was originally owned by farmer [[Farmer Carl Denkins|Carl Denkins]] but was bought by [[Kyle Broflovski]] and [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] because Denkins was going to kill him. They were looking for an entertaining turkey for the school Thanksgiving play, so Gobbles took up this role since they had spent all their budget.\n\nHe was named Gobbles by Timmy. Cartman and the other students consequently did not like him for his lack of capability and unusual appearance. However, Timmy quickly formed a close bond with Gobbles and he even jumped in front of the turkey and took a bullet when [[Jimbo Kern]] and his shooting companions tried to kill him.\n\nWith Timmy's training, he ends the play by \"jumping\" the flaming hoop of fire, instead of the professional turkey, which was shot and killed.\n\n==Appearance==\nGobbles is a turkey who has a neck problem. He is unable to lift his head for very long so consequentially his neck is always close to his feet. Ironically, this saves his life from a turkey slaughterhouse in the episode. Gobbles is also missing all its brown feathers.\n{{Minor Characters from Season Four}}\n[[es:Gobbles]]\n[[zh:咯咯]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters with deviations]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
