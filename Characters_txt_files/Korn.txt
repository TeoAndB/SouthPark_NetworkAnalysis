They agree that it is useless when facing off against three pirate ghosts, but admit they do it solely because they say \"It's just cool to do.\" The band is from Bakersfield, California and they premiered \"[[Falling Away from Me]]\", the first single from their fourth album, ''Issues'', in this episode. They also have a cameo in the intro from [[Season Six]].\n\n==Appearance==\nThey are all very off-style, almost nothing like a ''[[South Park]]'' character model. They all have beady eyes and the same skin color. They are of varying weights.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Korn\">\nKorn_Lg.png|Korn in their car\nKoRnSP_Lg.png|Korn performing in \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\".\n</gallery>\n\n==Personality==\nThe group behaves like five wholesome, polite, and sweet young men, with the stereotypical personalities of characters from 1960's Hanna-Barbara hit cartoon ''Scooby-Doo''. They often use phrases like \"Groovy\" and \"Golly\".\n\n==Trivia==\n*The five band members all performed their own voices in \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\".\n*Jonathan can be seen performing in a background screen during the MTV News in \"[[Timmy 2000]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Minor Characters from Season Three}}\n{{MusicCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Korn]]\n[[zh:科恩乐队]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Music celebrities]]\n[[Category:Celebrity voice actors]]\n[[Category:Characters with superpowers]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Groups]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]"
