Cheeses''' chain of American family restaurants. He appeared in the [[Season Twenty-One]] episode \"[[Hummels & Heroin]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAt [[Marcus Preston]]'s birthday party, his parents hire a man donning a Chuck E. Cheese costume to perform songs on stage to entertain him and his party guests. The man, under the influence of painkillers, performs poorly in front of the children, much to the disappointment of everyone except for Marcus. Only moments later the man violently vomits, collapses on stage, and dies. The children are left horrified, especially Marcus. Chuck E. Cheese is then carried away on a stretcher by the ambulance as Marcus promises to avenge him.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is a man in a Chuck E. Cheese costume which consists of a red long sleeved shirt under a blue T-shirt with a big 'C' on it, dark blue jeans, and black sneakers. Underneath the mask, the man has messy brown hair and a haggard-looking face, likely due to the drug use.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160\" spacing=\"small\" caption=\"Images of Chuck E.
