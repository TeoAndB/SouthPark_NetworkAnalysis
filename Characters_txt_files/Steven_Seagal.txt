[[Butters Stotch|Butters]] is then told to help him, just like he is helping [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. He also appears singing in the song \"[[In My Safe Space]]\", as well as at [[Randy Marsh|Randy]]'s charity dinner. He tries, unsuccessfully, to protect Randy from being pressured into donating money at the [[Whole Foods Market]]. He leaves after the [[Whole Foods Cashier|cashier]] references Seagal's movies going \"direct to cable\". He also unsuccessfully stops [[Reality]] from taking the stage at the charity dinner. It is worth mentioning that in both of these scenarios, Seagal does nothing but stand there with a gun.\n\n==Appearance==\nHe is overweight, and he has black hair pulled back in a ponytail with glasses. During most of the episode, he wears a black leather jacket (that is not big enough for him as his stomach sticks out at the bottom) and black pants. At the charity dinner, this is replaced with a white suit. In most scenes with Seagal, he is holding a pistol.\n\n==Personality==\nLike the other celebrities in this episode, Seagal cares very much about what others think of him. He cares enough that he needs the help of a fourth-grader to give him only the positive comments. He voices his discontent the most of anyone in this episode (perhaps besides Cartman), crying when he is told something he does not like. He is very sensitive about his weight, and his acting career.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Seagal's appearance is taken from his character in the movie ''[[wikipedia:Absolution (2015 film)|Absolution]]''.\n\n{{Minor Characters from Season Nineteen}}\n{{MovieCelebrities}}\n\n[[es:Steven Seagal]]\n[[ja:スティーヴン・セガール]]\n[[pl:Steven Seagal]]\n[[zh:史蒂文·西格尔]]\n[[Category:Overweight characters]]\n[[Category:Celebrities]]\n[[Category:Adult characters]]\n[[Category:Buddhists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters]]\n[[Category:One-off characters]]\n[[Category:Movie celebrities]]"
