   "source": "# Data Mining and Visualization of the South Park (SP) Wiki Archives\n\nThis notebook documents the final project assignment of the course 02805, social graphs and interactions. This ntoebook is accompanied by a Web site. The Web site serves as a more superficial overview of this project, whereas this notebook goes into the nitty gritty details of how all the results were achieved and calculated. \n\nWe chose South Park for our project because of the rich data sets that are available online. Specifically, we were limited to using a Wiki as our main source and the South Park Archives Wiki (https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park_Archives) has an amazing amount of data on almost two thousand characters from over 20 seasons. As we were encouraged to choose datasets, which would allow for large networks with many nodes, we thought that an innocent children’s show with such a deep data pool is the obvious choice! \n\nOur analysis focused on the entire network, however, we have also looked deeper into some of the main and major characters. We started out by building a large dataframe with all the characters, their genders, roles, and other attributes. Notebook A is where all of the data mining details are. Where as teh data analysis can be found in ntoebook B. This includes various networks, with different algorithms. These networks are built and visualised as beautifully as possible for three engineering students. Lastly, the sentiment, and communities are analysed, and some South Park word clouds are drawn. ",

   "source": "\n### **Purpose:**\nThs part mostly handles data mining and curating for the purpose of:\n- API handling of the wiki pages\n- creating a DataFrame object containing SouthPark (SP) characters and their attributes\n- data visualization done on the DataFrame object\n- creating the SP graphs\n- downloading TXT files from the  JSON contents\n- compiling clean word tokens of the TXT files\n\n### **WorkFlow:**\n1) APIs of the Wiki Pages were handled in order to retrieve the relevant JSON contents containing the relevant information of the wiki pages. Information regarding the SP characters and their role using RegEx patterns. And initial DataFrame object was formed.\n\n4) Using the retrieved JSON contents, TXT files containing the relevant information for each South Park character was downloaded and stored in the folder: Characters_txt_files. Those files were used to extract the gender, race, and epoisode appearance attributes. \n\n2) The SP characters as well as the retrieved attributes were added in a DataFrame object 'df_final', which was processed and stored for later usage as a CSV file: df_final_SouthPark_characters.csv. The attributes of df_final, which were categorical variables, were visualized using bar charts in order to asses the predominant attributes. \n\n3) Using the data from the DataFrame object, 2 graph were created (see subsection: Graphs) and exported as: graph.gexf and graph_game.gexf. Visualization of those graphs can be found in Part B. \n\n5) The TXT files from the Characters_txt_files folder were processed (clean word tokens were extracted) and saved under the folder: Characters_clean_tokens. The clear token files were used for further text analysis in Part B. \n##### **Main Wiki Fandoms:**\n\nSouth Park Archives: https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park_Archives \n\nSouth Park Archives: Wiki page for each SP character\n\nSouth Park Archives: Stick of Truth: https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth \n\n#### **API handling**\n\nWas done using these Wiki fandoms, as well as the Wiki page archive of each South Park character. \n\n\n#### **TXT files**\n\nThe TXT for each character were downloaded using the API content. A TXT file contains the main text content of the Wiki page for each South Park character \n\n\n#### **DataFrame object: df_final**\n\nA DataFram object 'df_final' was be compiled, containing:\n- Name: API  name of each South Park character (handling special characters)\n- Real_Name: real name of each South Park character (as it appears on the Wiki page)\n- Role: role in the 'Stick of Truth' Game: Playable Characters, Enemies, Land of Zaron, Merchants or Not in the Game\n- Attr: characters' role in the series (main character, major-supportive character, other (if not specified))\n- Gender: Male, Female or Unknown\n- Race: race of each South Park character\n- Appearance: Episode appearance\n\n#### **Graphs**\n##### **South Park Graph for the whole Series**\n\n**Nodes**: characters from the whole South Park Series\n**Node Attributes**:\n - real name: character name as it appears on the Wiki page\n - game role: Playable Characters, Enemies, Land of Zaron, Merchants or Not in the Game\n - series role: characters' role in the series (main character, major-supportive character, other (if not specified))\n - gender: Male, Female or Unknown\n - race\n - episode appearance\n\n**Edges**: each character will be linked to the other characters based on their interractions given by the Wiki pages\n\n##### **South Park Graph for the whole Game**\n\n**Nodes**: SP characters apparing in the Stick of Truth Game\n**Node Attributes**:\n - real name: character name as it appears on the Wiki page\n - game role: Playable Characters, Enemies, Land of Zaron, Merchants or Not in the Game\n - series role: characters' role in the series (main character, major-supportive character, other (if not specified))\n - gender\n - race\n\n**Edges**: each character will be linked to the other characters based on their interractions given by the Wiki pages\n\n\n#### **Clean Token files**\n\nBased on the TXT files, clean word tokens were compiled and saved for each South Park character.\n",

It seems that one of the largest categories are the 4th Graders and the Monsters. This is expected, as the main SP characters are 4th graders, and there are a lot of weird monsters and talking animals in the series. Another noticeable category is the Political Celebrities, which the series loves to make fun of. ",

Unfortunately most of the SP characters did not have assigned a race or it was not properly retrieved from the TXT files. But as far as the TXT files were looked through, the first reason seems more plausible. The most frequent revealed race of the South Park characters is Caucasian. It is expected that most of the SP characters are caucasian, as the series action takes place in the fictional South Park town which is supposedly located in the Colorado state in the US. Following this, it is also explainable why the second most-frequent race in the series is African-American. ",

Since the South Park universe is huge, it is expected that most of the characters are not in the Stick of Truth Game. \n\nReferring to the characters' categories in the game, the most frequent one is 'Other characters', followed by the 'Land of Zaron' and 'Enemies'. Playing the game, one can confirm that yes, a lot of the game characters belong to the 'Land of Zaron', which is the ally land assigned to find the stick of truth. However, most of the other characters make only a small appearance in the game, so it makes sense why they are not categorized. \n\nIn the game, one can battle with most characters, however they are not considered the main enemies of the story. This explains why the 'Enemies' category is not as large as the 'Other characters' category. ",
